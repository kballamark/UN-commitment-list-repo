It emphasizes the importance of early warning systems and risk assessment tools, critical water infrastructure, flood, and drought management, IWRM, climate resilience WASH and capacity building. However, these measures alone won't suffice. To completely tackle water risks, we must tap into private finance and explore options beyond conventional financial tools like bonds. The GCF has already mobilized USD 2.8 million for water security projects, guided by its sector-specific thematic areas. These funds have been allocated to a total of 38 projects across 58 countries. GCF's water projects recognize that water knows no boundaries and nexus approach. All water projects make up 51% of all water security, with 17% dedicated to agriculture and food security, 9% to ecosystems and ecosystem services, and 7% to early warning and early actions. The remaining activities are invested in energy, infrastructure, health, and wellbeing initiatives. This comprehensive approach ensures that every aspect of water security is addressed, promoting a sustainable future for all.","The GCF promotes innovative financing that leverages public and private investments to mobilize resources for water security. This includes not just grants and loans, but also equity investments, insurance and guarantees. Aligning investments for water security with climate action can create new financing opportunities, including new revenue streams and financing from climate-focused investors and public climate budgets/facilities. The GCF also sees the potential for water as a mitigation tool. While most climate finance goes to mitigation projects, the mitigation potential of water has been largely neglected (e.g. wetland restoration and conservation). This presents an opportunity to scale up efforts and align financing flows (e.g. biodiversity, water management, carbon credits). Additionally, the GCF promotes sustainable water management practices that conserve resources and protect ecosystems. It supports projects that enhance community adaptive capacity, particularly for those most vulnerable to climate change. The GCF's approach to water security demonstrates its commitment to combating climate change. It exemplifies its vision for a resilient and sustainable future where water is not a source of risk but of life. The GCF's strategic approach involves innovative financing, sustainable practices, viewing water as an asset class, supporting community resilience, and aligning with climate action - not just integrated water resources management.",Global,"Goal 1, Goal 6, Goal 13, Goal 14, Goal 15, Goal 17","1.1, 1.2 , 1.3 , 1.4, 1.5, 1.a, 1.b, 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.a, 13.b, 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5, 14.6, 14.7, 14.a, 14.b, 14.c, 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5, 15.6, 15.7, 15.8, 15.9, 15.a, 15.b, 15.c, 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4, 17.5, 17.6, 17.7, 17.8, 17.9, 17.10, 17.11, 17.12, 17.13, 17.14, 17.15, 17.16, 17.17, 17.18, 17.19","Mon, 01/01/2024 - 12:00","Fri, 12/31/2027 - 12:00","We release our technical annexes of Water Security are in the GCF website, which are complementary to the Water Security Sectoral Guide published last year.

1.-	Increase in Water Consumption. The water supply for both domestic and commercial connections will be constant, with no water cut-offs. Each user will have the water they require, according to their needs and willingness to pay. (6.1 By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all)
2.-	Savings due to Water Diseases. The lack of drainage infrastructure and wastewater treatment generates stomach diseases in the population, so that medical attention and rest for people suffering from these ailments is necessary. (6.2 By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations)
3.-	Savings from the purchase of pipes. Inhabitants who do not have a constant service, as well as those who are not within the hydraulic network, require drinking water to be supplied by means of pipes. This has a very high cost in terms of time, money, and effort. (6.4 By 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity)
4.-	Savings in water pumping due to greater efficiency of the drinking water distribution network. The hydraulic infrastructure for the provision of drinking water will be renovated, so that water losses in the distribution network will be lower. The exploitation of the aquifers will be more effective and efficient, in such a way that the differences between supply and consumption will be smaller. (6.5 By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels)
5.-	Increase in the value of the land in area of influence. When the network is already installed and fully operational, the area will have an efficient supply of drinking water, there will be no bad smells because it will already have drainage and sewerage. This means an integral improvement in the wellbeing of the population in influence of the project and finally translates into an increase in the value of the real estate infrastructure.  (6.2 By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations)
6.-	Savings in electricity consumption. The most important cost of the operation of ODAPAS is the consumption of electricity. The present project contemplates the replacement of pumping machinery with greater energy efficiency, as well as an orientation of the entire organization to reduce the cost of electrical energy. (6.5 By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels)
7.-	Financial self-sufficiency of ODAPAS Aculco. The final objective of the project of integral improvement of the management of ODAPAS is to achieve financial self-sufficiency, as it is currently in the red, i.e., expenses are greater than income.

            Establishment of a UN Trust Fund in support of activities for glaciers’ preservation.","Planet inhabitants reliant on glaciers and snow, as well as those directly impacted by the Earth's cryospheric processes",Global,Global,"Amidst the impact of climate change, the planet's critical freshwater resources are rapidly melting, posing significant threats to the water cycle and the future of our planet. According to authoritative reports like the IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate 2019 (SROCC), up to a third of the world's glaciers could vanish by the end of this century. Likewise, the Hindu Kush Himalaya Assessment highlights the potential loss of more than two-thirds of Himalayan glaciers in the same timeframe. A similar concerning situation is observed with the Pamir glaciers, which serve as the primary water source for the Amu Darya basin. In Tajikistan alone, over 1,000 glaciers have completely melted over the past few decades.
Another severe consequence of glacier melting is the proliferation of glacial lakes, leading to devastating floods worldwide. Glacial lake outbursts (GLOFs) in regions like the Andes, Himalayas, and Alps have resulted in numerous casualties and extensive damage to infrastructure.
Scientific evidence underscores the global variation in glacier melting rates with significant inter-annual fluctuations. However, the overall projection points to a dramatic decline in the freshwater supply derived from glaciers by the end of the century, with severe implications for society and the economy. 
Organizing an international conference on preservation of glaciers in 2025 (following the initiative of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan supported through the UN resolution on declaring a year 2025 - an International Year of Glaciers' preservation) will offer an opportunity to raise awareness and address the escalating challenges posed by the global climate change and water crisis worldwide. It will urge governments, corporations, and individuals to take urgent action concerning water resources and the preservation of glaciers from intensive melting and disappearance. It is expected to reinforce global efforts in mitigating climate change.
The conference participants will endeavor to:
Develop a comprehensive cross-sectoral approach to prioritize actions and investments aimed at activating measures in water and climate-related fields while achieving Sustainable Development Goals through integrated solutions.
Enhance and disseminate knowledge and best practices in glacier monitoring and water resource management.
Align national priorities and initiatives specified in the NDCs and NAPs to formulate and implement sustainable water resource management guidelines and associated services through ambitious and interconnected climate and water policies.
Identify practical steps to advance scientific research and expand access to data while addressing gaps to improve hydro-meteorological and climate services, optimizing cryosphere earth observations.
Establish roadmaps for climate risks and early warning systems specific to mountainous regions.
Share experiences and transformative practices among countries related to water resource sustainability and security, including efforts to promote gender equality in the water sector and encourage women's participation in policy development.
Support well-founded decisions in financing and enhancing the resilience of irrigation systems and agricultural productivity through efficient water resource utilization.
Encourage experts, policymakers, investors, and the public to further develop and fortify urban water supply systems.
Determine practical steps towards the establishment of a UN Trust Fund to support glacier preservation efforts.","The ultimate objective is to ensure that individuals reliant on glaciers and snow, as well as those directly impacted by the Earth's cryospheric processes, receive hydrological, meteorological, and climate services specifically tailored to their needs. These services should acknowledge the vital role of mountain regions as the cradle of the cryosphere and the primary source of global freshwater and ecosystem services for the entire world. This endeavor is anticipated to provide an additional boost to global endeavors aimed at limiting, and if feasible, preventing global warming through diverse measures and actions aimed at safeguarding glaciers from intense melting and disappearance.
To achieve this goal, the following key factors will be pursued:
Facilitating collaboration among countries and stakeholders within the framework of the UN Agenda for Action on Water Resources and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
Demonstrating strong policy commitments and high-level engagement from interested parties, exemplifying transformative dedication.

Since the mechanism was launched in 2018, over 400 global and national commitments have been made, with half of them coming from 60 UN Member States. Commitments are periodically monitored by partners and the first MAM Global Report can be found here. 
SWA commits to continue working to implement the Mutual Accountability Mechanism among its partner countries and at the global level.  
Furthermore, SWA is putting its accountability mechanism at the disposal of all sector actors, SWA partner or not, to contribute to the tracking and follow-up to the UN 2023 Water Conference and the Water Action Agenda commitments related to water, sanitation and hygiene.    
To enable this process, SWA encourages governments, external support agencies, and other non-governmental partners to bring the pledges they made in the context of the UN 2023 Water Conference and the Water Action Agenda to the MAM, so we may include them in our continuous accountability processes.  
By bringing their pledges to the SWA Mutual Accountability Mechanism national governments and non-governmental organizations working in the water, sanitation and hygiene sector will be able to:  
1. More strongly engage in continuous accountability processes
2. Support engagement with partners who can collaborate with their implementation and mutual review, and
3. Promote opportunities to share their priorities and showcase progress through our High-level Meetings, MAM global reports, and communication channels.","The SWA Mutual Accountability Mechanism process can help strengthen accountability in the sector and sustain momentum after the historic UN 2023 Water Conference.  
A human rights principle, accountability is about how promises are translated into action and aspirations into reality. While States ultimately have an obligation to ensure the realization of the human rights to water and sanitation, all stakeholders have a role to play in moving our societies toward the vision laid out in the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.  
In response to this need, the Sanitation and Water for All partnership created the Mutual Accountability Mechanism in 2018: a tool for partners to commit and hold each other to account for progress in achieving the SDGs’ water and sanitation targets – as well as an opportunity to collaborate, learn and catalyze collective action.","The Sanitation and Water for All partnership is composed by 88 UN Member States, 350+ non-governmental organizations, including approximately 200 civil society organisations, private sector companies, as well as external support agencies such as UN agencies, development agencies, development banks and donors.",Goal 6,"6.1 , 6.2","Sat, 11/18/2023 - 12:00","Wed, 07/31/2030 - 12:00","Deliverables:

The UNAI working group focus is on SDG 6 and brings together established and emerging leaders who have a shared interest in freshwater sustainability, and who work collaboratively with national and global partners to address the issues related to climate change impacts on freshwater systems at local, regional and national scales. Members include researchers from the Clayton H. Riddell Faculty of Environment, Earth and Resources, the Faculty of Agricultural and Food Sciences, the Faculty of Arts, and the Faculty of Science, as well as collaborators at the Centre for Human Rights Research and the Office of Sustainability. The SDG group’s expertise spans multiple disciplines including leading researchers from across the humanities, social sciences and STEM fields. 
As freshwater is necessary for all life, the work of the UM UNAI group connects all other SDGs. For instance, sustainable water governance is only possible when other SDGs like Gender Equality (SDG 5), Reduced Inequality (SDG 10), Climate Action (SDG 13), and Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions (SDG 17) are also supported. We are committed to advancing the human right to clean water for all and advancing peace and conflict resolution through education. We accomplish this through multiple approaches, including a university-led commitment to educational opportunity for all people, advancing Indigenous reconciliation and self-determination, and promoting intercultural dialogue and understanding. We action these approaches through activities like the webinar series “The Last Drop” hosted by the UNAI, the “Critical Conversations Series roundtable on Water and Borders” hosted by the Centre for Human Rights Research and the UNAI, and by promoting sustainability through education both directly in the academic curriculum and through the Office of Sustainability. UM UNAI researchers are involved in multiple projects that further the water action agenda – for example:
•	Coastal Habitat Comprehensive Research Project – which addresses long-standing concerns of the coastal Cree about water quality and habitat impacts on their hunting area;
•	Antimicrobial Resistance Laboratory – which studies the microbiological quality of drinking water from First Nations in Manitoba; and
•	Decolonizing Water Governance through Indigenous Knowledge, Self-determination and Relationships with Water program.","• Through our collaborations, we will address global issues related to water quality and quantity and support local, regional and global efforts to protect and restore water-related ecosystems. 
• We will support the ethical, open sharing of reproducible water quality/quantity data to increase the accessibility and availability of information available to communities and use data analytics to address actionable questions. Through the creation of understandable and actionable data and information products we will provide key research back into the hands of the rights holders and for evidence-based policymaking.

Previously, wildfire survivors, hurricane survivors, earthquake survivors, and frontline workers during the COVID19 pandemic in the United States, Ecuador, Nicaragua","Ecuador, Nicaragua, United States of America, Zimbabwe","Africa, Global","The Fyera Foundation and HeartAmbassadors were established in 2002 to bring the science of heart intelligence to the manifestation of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals in the 2030 United Nations Agenda. Together we connect individuals and large populations to the power and intelligence of compassion and love, proven by science to improve health, productivity, and effective solution-seeking.  We apply this heart intelligence to the world's biggest problems. 
One of the largest problems faced by the world's human populations today is lack of access to clean water for drinking and sanitation (SDG6).  In her groundbreaking book The Business Plan for Peace, Dr Scilla Elworthy, three times Nobel Peace Prize nominee and a partner of The Fyera Foundation, has proposed that every person on Earth could be fed, housed, educated and have access to clean water for a very small fraction of the global expenditures on war, security and defense. In other words, what gets in the way of providing humanity with basic needs like clean water for drinking and sanitation is not a lack of financial or physical resources, but human decisions about the distribution of resources made from prioritizing defense over compassion and care to meet people’s basic needs.
The perception of national and international insecurity and the threat that drives defensive decision-making and monetizing military might, above all else, comes from a basic physiological survival imperative of the flight, fight, freeze, appease nervous system or ""survival mode."" For humanity to survive in the modern era we must rise above this protection of a delusional ""separate sense of self,"" as Einstein called it, and transcend our individual and national preoccupation with personal survival, to a focus on collective thriving. The HeartMath Institute, another partner of The Fyera Foundation, has demonstrated that simple self-regulation skills can assist us in making a shift from ""survival"" physiology and stress to ""thriving"" physiology and optimal performance by changing our heart rhythms from chaotic to coherent patterns in a literal heartbeat.
This change of heart can activate sufficient human compassion and care to alter both the collective and the political will of our time, moving beliefs, actions, and even policies in such a way that ensures more of the world's population will have access to what should be their birthright - clean water. 
We teach evidenced-based skills from The HeartMath Institute to help people:
1) Reduce stress and increase resilience and energy, which then
2) frees their intelligence and life force, opening their human heart for service and philanthropy beyond their own self-interest and personal gain.
We then educate people to appreciate their unique access to clean water for drinking and sanitation, and give them pathways to invest their time, money, and expertise in ensuring more of the world's population is given access to clean water for drinking and sanitation.","In 2017 The Fyera Foundation and our HeartAmbassadors members, having gone through the process outlined above to self-regulate our own stress and self-interest and lift our gaze and capacity in service to the global need, made a commitment to bring 10,000 people clean drinking water for 10 years every World Water Day March 22. This led us to explore partnerships and best practices over the last five years in alignment with that goal, an exploration which included but was not limited to:
1) Distributing water filters to communities who have access to water that is contaminated with pollutants or micro-organisms (Nicaragua, Ecuador, Nepal)
2) Drilling wells and boreholes in communities that have to travel long distances to access water, compromising community health, food security, and the rights and education of women and girl children who were most often the water carriers (Zimbabwe). We found there that clean water provided so much more than water, it provided dignity, hope, health, food stabilization, sustainable and dignified income through agricultural production, and freedom, education and new futures for women and girls.
3) Distribution of clean bottled water and water filtration for communities effected by natural and human made disasters including earthquakes, fires, flooding, toxic environmental disasters, violent conflicts and more (United States, Afghanistan, Nepal, Nicaragua, Ecuador)
While providing communities in chronic or acute crisis with clean water, meeting this basic need for survival frees their attention to then receive the same teachings on self-regulation we brought to their benefactors. This learning to shift to a thriving physiology empowers people to create and innovate sustainable solutions to their own community’s problems and needs. Together both benefactors and beneficiaries are linked arm and arm in learning to set down arms as weapons, and use arms to embrace new and better futures for themselves and the world with the physiology of thriving instead of mere surviving. 
The last five years have taught us much about what works and what doesn't in the global effort to increase accessibility to a clean water supply for the world's populations. As we continue to learn and grow from our successes, mistakes, and esteemed partners, we anticipate increasing our annual goal of 10,000 people receiving clean water for 10 years every World Water Day. We plan to do this at the pace of effective scalability, while simultaneously scaling the numbers of our individual and corporate community members who understand the value and importance of investing their resources to benefit others with clean water. Short term, we have already chosen two additional villages to impact 1,400 households and 1,600 hundred children in these two villages.  Our target for that short term project is to impact a total of 15,000 households and 20,000 children. 
 The ultimate long term result of expansion will be more wells, more well-being, more peace and human dignity, and a world that works better for all.","What makes water unique is its hydrogen bonds. Through hydrogen bonding, water is the only element that expands when it freezes, that seeks the path of least resistance, and can flow to accommodate any space it has to fill, has surface tension, and most important of all gives birth to life. One of the criteria astronomers and cosmologists look for when seeking other planets in our universe that can sustain life is, ""Does this planet have water?"" As the source of life through hydrogen bonding, pathways to providing clean water to the life on this planet can be found through our bonds, our collaborative and healthy partnerships that focus on fostering and nurturing life rather than defending life at the expense of life.

According to a recent report by Human Rights Watch, a third of Zimbabwe’s rural population is without proper water infrastructure. This forces many to resort to unsafe alternatives such as unprotected, hand-dug wells. These wells are often exposed to an array of life-threatening microbiological pollutants that spread diseases such as cholera and typhoid. The average woman or girl travels 6 miles to have access to potable or semi-potable water.  Most frequently, these tasks fall to the young woman in the family who cannot access education while fulfilling this obligation. The lack of access to water also restricts the ability of local communities and families' ability to grow crops in a sustainable and regenerative manner.  We seek to replicate our project in the village of Chipuko where we successfully completed the drilling of a solar-powered borehole that now provides water to 1,119 families, including 1,220 school-age children. The availability of water has allowed for more young girls to access the schools, children are receiving nutrition supplementation meals at the school, and we have started a sustainable organic regeneration agricultural community project that now provides a source of fresh vegetables to the village  and a source of income to cover the costs of the maintenance of the well making it an integrated sustainable project.  We are proposing to replicate this project in 10 more villages in the next 5 years. The selection process for additional target locations includes consultation with Water Line Ministry, Ministry of Agriculture, local leaders, and UNICEF. A local consultant will visit and evaluate each potential site to confirm population impact, quotes, providers, and community involvement.
We provide this education and opportunities for service multi-culturally and intergenerationally. Our Change for Change program is one example of this, effectively changing the mindset of kids in the United States that take a lot for granted and inspiring them to do more to help others who have much less. The program was initiated by a Fyera volunteer in two elementary schools, who gifted 260 students as young as 6 years old with two pennies and let them choose to keep the coins or to donate to a water project to help others. After two years of seeing the impact of their donations, the students feel good about making a difference, and they are eager to donate when the next opportunity arises.  Some of the kids ages 8 and above, have started saving money to donate for future projects. Change for Change is an easy way to get young students involved in caring about people in other countries and wanting to help out.",0.875,0.5555555555555556,0.0,0.125,1.0,0.2197802197802206

This collaboration involves marine scientists, the public health community, and multidisciplinary experts.
This original Italian partnership aims to align actions with the sustainable development goals, embracing the concepts of ""one health"" and ""one water,"" to explore the complex and interdependent relationships between marine environments and human health.
The ""Sea-care"" project is a collaboration between the National Institute of Health (ISS), the Italian Navy, and with the support of SNPA (National System for Environmental Protection) and other research organizations. It seeks to generate extensive knowledge on persistent chemical contamination and its biological impacts using a sustainable approach. This will help overcome the scientific uncertainties associated with site-specific or limited-scale surveys of globally significant phenomena in environments of extraordinary complexity.","Planetary health refers to the health of the human population and the state of the natural systems on which it depends.
Starting with integration and going beyond the ""from source to sea"" approach, the concept of ""one ocean"" encompasses the resources where all the objectives of the UN agenda on sustainable development coexist and sometimes conflict. Investigating and understanding phenomena in this environment is an incredibly challenging task that requires aligning interests and ensuring sustainability for the oceans.
The project aims to study the effects of human activities and global climate and environmental changes to assess potential health risks. It also aims to improve health prevention strategies in a complex environmental scenario and support the development of remediation and prevention policies.
We propose a transnational and multi-sectoral approach in which government institutions, the scientific community, and civil society collaborate to optimize resources and synergies.
Through this initiative, our goal is to develop a new methodological approach for collecting information and data on a global scale, thereby reducing the errors that often occur in the analysis of large datasets. This approach will enable us to better understand the distribution of anthropogenic substances in marine environments, pathways of exposure, and the associated risks to human health.

With over 30 years of combined experience in supporting countries in establishing Early Warning Systems (EWS), the programs have developed a well-tested and solid approach that puts people first and understands and implements EWS as a crucial element of overall resilience building.
We recognize that despite the establishment of EWS in many countries, the number of victims and overall impacts (both direct and indirect) of floods and droughts are still very high. Often, in emergency situations, warnings fail due to gaps either on the “last mile” of the warning chain or because the recipients are not prepared to react and respond in a timely and adequate manner. This is especially true for the most vulnerable like refugees, impoverished populations, women, elderly and other marginalized groups, who are often not prioritized when planning and setting up the warning chain.
As a contribution to the UN “Early Warnings for All” Action Plan, this APFM and IDMP initiative is supporting countries in improving existing or establishing new people-centric and integrated EWS. It will focus on making sure that the technical systems are integrated into an overall flood and drought management policy framework and that all relevant stakeholders - particularly the most vulnerable - participate and are considered when planning and establishing the warning and response chain. This includes awareness raising and sustained mechanisms to train people on response capacities so that warnings trigger (early) action when flood and droughts are happening.","This initiative will support the achievement of several SDG targets related to disaster resilience by building EWS based on the concept of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). This will enable multiple SDG targets to be linked together and contribute to their achievement. Flood and drought are natural phenomena, but their frequency and magnitude are increasing in many regions around the world due to climate change. We cannot stop floods and droughts from happening, but we can mitigate or even prevent their impacts by being not just proactive but prospective in drought management and increasing the resilience of the most vulnerable. Intact ecosystems are crucial to mitigate flood and drought risk and vice versa but are often forgotten when discussing vulnerabilities or impacts of flood and drought.
This shows that building flood and drought resilience integrates climate change adaptation with poverty reduction and ecosystem conservation and supports therefore the achievement of a broad range of SDGs:
o	“Build the resilience of the poor and those in vulnerable situations and reduce their exposure and vulnerability to climate-related extreme events and other economic, social and environmental shocks and disasters” SDG 1, target 1.5
o	“Help maintain ecosystems, that strengthen capacity for adaptation to climate change, extreme weather, drought, flooding and other disasters and that progressively improve land and soil quality” SDG 2, target 2.4
o	“Implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate” SDG 6, target 6.5
o	“Significantly reduce the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct economic losses relative to global gross domestic product caused by disasters, including water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations” SDG 11, target 11.5
o	“Substantially increase the number of cities and human settlements adopting and implementing integrated policies and plans towards inclusion, resource efficiency, mitigation and adaptation to climate change, resilience to disasters, and develop and implement, in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, holistic disaster risk management at all levels” SDG 11, target 11b

            Implement a strengthened Freshwater Action Plan and create a Canada Water Agency.","-	Indigenous Peoples, provincial and territorial governments, stakeholders, and the public",Canada,North America,"Advancing freshwater protection is a priority of the Government of Canada, which has made commitments to implement a strengthened Freshwater Action Plan and establish a Canada Water Agency. 
The Canada Water Agency is a unique opportunity for Canada to work together with the provinces, territories, Indigenous communities, local authorities, scientists and others to find the best ways to keep our water safe, clean and well-managed.
On March 28, through Budget 2023, the Government of Canada announced a major investment in Canada’s freshwater, including:
•	$650 million over ten years, starting in 2023-24, to support monitoring, assessment, and restoration work in the Great Lakes, Lake Winnipeg, Lake of the Woods, St. Lawrence River, Fraser River, Saint John River, Mackenzie River, and Lake Simcoe.
•	$22.6 million over three years, starting in 2023-24, to support better coordination of efforts to protect freshwater across Canada.
•	$85.1 million over five years, starting in 2023-24, and $21 million per year ongoing thereafter to support the creation of a Canada Water Agency, which will be headquartered in Winnipeg. By the end of 2023, the government will introduce legislation that will fully establish the Canada Water Agency as a standalone entity.
The Government of Canada has also committed to advance the modernization of the Canada Water Act to reflect Canada’s freshwater reality, including climate change and Indigenous rights.","Canada is home to 20 per cent of the world’s freshwater supply. Recognizing the threat to fresh water caused by climate change and pollution, the federal government is moving forward on these freshwater investments. 
For many Indigenous Peoples water is sacred, protected, and honoured as the giver of all life. Fresh water is essential to health and critical for the economy. Lakes and rivers across Canada support fisheries, forestry, agriculture, energy, manufacturing, recreation and tourism, shipping, and navigation. 
Strong freshwater stewardship is critical to ensure the well-being of ecosystems and communities. As such, implementing a strengthened Freshwater Action Plan and investing in the restoration of large lakes and river systems are key freshwater priorities for the Government of Canada. Watershed-based approaches are and will continue to underpin Canada’s investment in freshwater protection and management.
The Canada Water Agency represents an opportunity for the federal government to work collaboratively with provinces, territories, Indigenous Peoples, and local governments to strengthen Canada’s water resilience. 
The modernization of the Canada Water Act is an opportunity to reflect climate change, Indigenous rights, and potentially other topics into the legislation.  
Implementing a strengthened Freshwater Action Plan, the creation of a Canada Water Agency, and the modernization of the Canada Water Act will directly contribute to Sustainable Development Goal 6 – clean water and sanitation for all, by protecting fresh water in Canada. These investments will also benefit other Sustainable Development Goals and advance the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
Parallel to these freshwater initiatives, Canada also works with First Nations to support the development and implementation of community-based source water protection plans to help ensure the sustainable provision of safe drinking water now and for future generations. These initiatives are separate from the implementation of the Freshwater Action Plan, creation of the Canada Water Agency, and modernization of the Canada Water Act and will be completed on a separate timeline.",,Goal 6,"6.3, 6.5, 6.6, 6.b",,,https://www.canada.ca/en/environment-climate-change/services/water-over…,0.5,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05494505494505515

            3) Support Ugandan national and subnational WASH systems for advancing equitable, sustainable and resilient services to all","Uganda and neighboring countries where refugees come from such as DR Congo and South Sudan 
Refugees and host communities in Uganda",Uganda,Africa,"Uganda continues to be Africa’s largest refugee hosting country with over 1.5 million refugees located across thirteen districts. About 94 percent of refugees live in settlements alongside host communities. Uganda has a progressive refugee policy anchored in the 2006 Refugee Act that allows refugees freedom of movement, the rights to work, establish a business, own property, and access national services, including primary and secondary education and health care.  The sudden build-up of large populations of refugees in camps however results into uncontrolled exploitation of the environment and natural resources. 
In 2019, Ministry of Water and Environment  developed a Water and Environment Sector Response Plan for Refugees and hosting population aimed at providing a framework for orderly and integrated planning and implementation of water and sanitation infrastructures, and management of water and environment resources. The Plan was developed within the context of the comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF) for the refugees and host communities in Uganda.
With the Water Environment Refugee Response Plan (WERRP) in full implementation, the sector is focusing on the inclusion of WASH service delivery into government-mandated institutions which will take the lead role in the planning, design, implementation, coordination, operation, and maintenance of WASH initiatives in respective areas. 
Climate change is real and is already impacting the environment and settlements. Flood and drought have affected the provision of WASH and environment services over the years. In 2022 alone, over 1,000 family latrines and shelters were destroyed due to floods in two refugee settlements with a restoration value beyond a million dollars. Many people have been displaced or have migrated because of either floods, droughts or lack of adequate water and of good quality.  It is therefore difficult to draw the line between conflict induced migration and climate induced migration. Nonetheless, Uganda’s response to these migrations has been holistic with the open-door policy. 
The Government of Uganda therefore collaborates with many humanitarian and development partners in the implementation of projects linked to water services and water security.  While there is good progress in addressing the refugee crisis caused by conflicts and climate change challenges, there are however implications of poor planning of settlement sites, selection of water management models and strategies to address issues. The water and environment sector response plan has enabled leveraging of development partners’ funding to support planning and provision of services in refugee hosting districts. Over the years, Euros 149 Million has been committed from various development partners such as the World bank, KfW, AFD, EU, Danida, GiZ, and others to build permanent infrastructure benefiting both the refugees and the host communities.  
In order to fully respond to the above challenges there is need to scale up Uganda’s response to conflict and climate change induced migration and displacement through improved water services and water security. There  is need to pursue innovative financing options that goes beyond the current funding by donors such as climate related funding options, private sector and corporate social responsibilities of companies and agencies.","All refugee hosting districts have had some interventions for improving water services and water security over the last years. These include construction of WASH facilities, tree planting, capacity building, energy conservation, soil and water conservation, and restoring degraded riverbanks and streams. However not much impact has been realized on the ground. Fragile ecosystems such as streams and riverbanks as well as bare hills has been encroached affecting their natural ecological functions. Forests in particular have been seriously affected having been cleared for agriculture, firewood, charcoal burning and collection of building materials among others. In view of the above, sustainable development and management of water, environment and natural resources  need to be given priority in order to holistically respond to conflict and climate change induced migration and displacement.","•	Office of the Prime Minister

This commitment aims to support the implementation of existing global and regional treaties, and declarations, It will consider available authoritative guidance, practical material and tools on obligations by States and responsibilities of non-State actors such as: CESCR's Committee's General Comments No. 15 (2002) on the right to water, No. 13 (1999) on the right to education, No. 26 (2022) on land and economic, social and cultural rights; CEDAW Committee's General recommendation No. 36 (2017) on the right of girls and women to education,  No.39 (2022) on the rights of Indigenous women and Girls, and No.37 (2018) on gender-related dimensions of disaster risk reduction in a changing climate; OHCHR’s work on human rights indicators and the joint Fact Sheet on the right to water; UN-Water policy brief Eliminating Discrimination and Inequalities in Access to Water and Sanitation; and guidance from Human Rights Council's Special procedures, mainly the Special Rapporteurs (SR) on the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation- of which the Handbook on realizing the human rights to water and sanitation (2014); SR's on the rights to health, adequate housing, food, and the environment. 
Practical tools and guidance documents under the framework of the UNECE-WHO/Europe Protocol on Water and Health, particularly, the Equitable Access Score-card supports countries in analyzing the governance frameworks in place on equitable access to water and sanitation and the existing public policies to reduce geographical disparities, overcome barriers faced by groups in situations of vulnerability and marginalization and address affordability concerns. This self-assessment helps to identify where the gaps are, both policy and data gaps, as well as priority areas of action. Based on the self-assessment exercise, countries can develop action plans, roadmaps, or specific equity targets. The Score-card can be applied worldwide and has already been applied in 12 countries, with numerous other countries wanting to apply it in future years. 
OHCHR and UNECE commit to working together on strengthening the implementation of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation at national, regional and global levels by:
-Supporting the application of the Equitable Access Score-card and human rights indicators in interested countries, in line with the obligation to ensure equal and non-discriminatory access;
-Supporting the development of roadmaps/action plans/equity targets based on the gaps identified within the scope of the self-assessment, and in line with countries’ human rights obligations under the treaties;
-Systematic exchange of information and timely coordination in the context of country-specific initiatives, including missions or requests for support;
-Ensuring participation to mutual meetings, including expert groups relevant to the scope and content of the rights to water and sanitation, including equal and non-discriminatory access, and fostering the meaningful participation of rights holders;
-Joint promotion efforts on the scope and content of the rights to water and sanitation;
-Raising awareness about the use of the Protocol tools to implement international obligations on equity including EU Directives on water and sanitation.","The collaboration between OHCHR and UNECE has the added value of engaging diverse professional communities to support the implementation of human rights, including law professionals, engineers, water and sanitation professionals, public health professionals, hydrologists and economists, as well as water defenders and communities, broadening the range of impacts that can be achieved through the commitment. At national level, this strongly facilitates inter-sectoral cooperation and mobilizes the many different constituencies that work, in practice, on efforts to ensure the realization of human rights.
The commitment will strengthen the implementation of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation. Expected impacts in countries will range from:
•	Identification of baseline measure in terms of policies and practices on equal and non- discriminatory access to water, sanitation and hygiene;
•	Development of tailored national water strategies and action plans, as well as equity actions plans, where applicable. Equity action plans typically identify concrete measures to be adopted, evaluation criteria, responsible authorities and relevant partners, budgetary implications and sources of funding.

The people of Uganda living in both rural and urban areas",Uganda,Africa,"Water resources in Uganda are facing several challenges and pressures, such as high population growth, environmental degradation of vital ecosystems like forests, wetlands and riverbanks, pollution, climate variability and change, etc. The Climate Change Country Profile for Uganda shows a statistically significant decreasing trend in the annual rainfall and general warming trend. The implications have been droughts, floods, landslides and rising water levels in major water bodies like Lake Victoria that have negatively reduced the quality and quantity of water resources thus impacting on the socio-economic development and resilience of Uganda. There is also insufficient funding and capacity for enhancing the resilience of the country to the climate change shocks. 
Uganda has taken the adaptation approach to dealing with the Climate change and related challenges with the implementation of the integrated water resources management whose success stands at 59%. The updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) of Uganda that was submitted to the UNFCCC in September 2022 recognizes water as one of the priority adaptation sectors and the importance of water in addressing climate change. The updated Nationally Determined Contributions gives special focus to ensuring resilient water supply systems for domestic and productive uses, promoting sustainable water harvesting and storage, increasing sanitation and waste water treatment infrastructure and services, scaling up integrated water resources management approaches and water use efficiency, and protection of ecosystems. 
 A number of approaches have been adopted in response to the above challenges and in order to implement the updated NDC such as the catchment based approach to water resources planning, development and management; development of the national flood management strategy and action plan to guide coordinated actions; utilization of groundwater resources as one of the vital sources of water to support social economic development; construction of dams and valley tanks, construction of irrigation schemes, construction of water and sanitation systems, implementation of nature based solutions through restoration and sustainable utilization of degraded ecosystems etc. These approaches therefore need to be scaled up as part of implementation of the updated NDC for Uganda.","Climate change remains the greatest challenge undermining the achievement of sustainable development at all levels. Uganda is experiencing significant impacts of climate change, which include changing weather patterns, drop in water levels, and increased frequency of extreme climate risks and hazards, whose socio-economic impacts make communities very vulnerable. These extreme events are increasing in frequency and intensity, and greatly affecting water availability, quality, and security with serious implications on water-dependent sectors, particularly agriculture, health, education, and energy. The above problems are exacerbated by rampant environmental degradation and limited human capacity to manage and safeguard the various natural resources.  Uganda ranks the 40th out of the 180 most vulnerable countries in the world with low adaptive capacity to the impacts of climate change. However, government has taken several measures to safeguard freshwater resources, protect biodiversity and ensure sustainable development and resilient livelihoods. This new action will therefore improve Uganda’s resilience to Climate Change.","Various Development partners such as the World Bank, African Development Bank, bi-lateral donors etc

River basin organizations, civil society, private sector, water professionals",Uganda,Africa,"Water accelerates action across the whole Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) agenda because of its interconnections with a range of sectors such as health, agriculture, protection of biodiversity and enhancing climate action, energy, sustaining peace and regional integration, and, as such, can supply life, food security, livelihoods as well as transform the global economy. 
Uganda’s Vision 2040 aims to transform the country from a predominantly rural and low-income economy to a competitive upper middle-income economy. Water has been recognized as an opportunity and pillar in the Uganda Vision 2040 and the National Development Plan (NDP III).  Water plays a critical role in employment and wealth creation, enhancement of Uganda’s competitiveness and in fostering socio-economic transformation. Uganda has already integrated SDGs in its National Development Plan whose implementation is under way. SDG6 indicators have also been integrated in the revised water and environmental sector performance monitoring framework in Uganda and the country will be reporting formally on the revised framework regularly. 
Uganda has made significant progress in improving the efficiency with which it uses it water resources with water use efficiency at US$ 28.8 per cubic meter and a water stress level of 5.8%.  Efforts have been made to implement integrated water resources development and management plans in 19 out of 32 catchments in the country and these are guiding planning and implementation of water related programs by all the stakeholders, resulting in water use efficiency improvement. Implementation of integrated water resources management is ongoing and the degree of its implementation stands at 59% while the proportion of trans-boundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation level stands at 84%. 
In terms of financing, the country requires USD1.7 billion annually to implement water and environment related programs to help improve people’s social and economic welfare, livelihoods and incomes and help the country ensure availability of water for sustainable development. However, only USD 0.4 Billion has been mobilized from various sources constituting only 25% of the required funds. The low funding coupled with limited human and institutional capacity and inadequate coordination and collaboration  has made it difficult to promote water for sustainable development and maximum the benefits of multipurpose use of water. 
Building human and institutional capacity through existing sector specific capacity building institutions, strengthening coordination and collaboration  through existing governance arrangements, and mobilizing innovative financing will strengthen the country’s ability to promote use of water for sustainable development and maximize the benefits from the use, development and management of water resources.
As a way of ensuring availability of water for sustainable development and for realizing the nexus approach to water-energy- food and ecosystem Uganda commits to ensure availability of adequate and good quality water for domestic use and for productive purposes through transformational initiatives such as sourcing for innovative financing, impact-based research, community-driven activities, and private sector investments with a focus on marginalized groups (youth, women, and people with disabilities) so that no one is left behind.","1)	Transformational initiatives will be put in place through impact-based research, community driven activities, private sector investments  to ensure sustainable management of water for production, water supply and sanitation to extend services such that no one is left behind

While access to sanitation in rural areas is at 77% and 90.6 % for urban areas in comparison to Africa’s average of 63%. However, safely managed sanitation services are still very low and stands at 8.2% (rural areas) and 40.7% (urban areas). 
Uganda is however facing the challenge of emerging environmental contaminants such as plastics, trace organic and inorganic contaminants, which are increasingly being detected in the water with potential implication on the health of the population. In addition, financing for water for health remains a challenge to Uganda. Uganda requires USD1.7 billion annually to implement water and environment related programs to help improve people’s social and economic welfare, livelihoods, and incomes.  However, only USD 0.4 Billion has been mobilized from various sources constituting only 25% of the required funds. 
Building human and institutional capacity, investing in knowledge generation, integration of management information systems, and mobilizing innovative financing will enable Uganda to ensure access to safely managed water and sanitation services and achieve SDG6 and related targets. Uganda will continue to work with all of its partners to accelerate the provision of water and sanitation services to the people of Uganda, including refugees. 
In order to improve this situation, the country commits to accelerate inclusive access to safely managed water and sanitation services in both rural and urban areas including public institutions (schools and health facilities), through investing in infrastructure, knowledge generation, integration of management information systems, and evidence sharing and learning in order to reach out to the underserved population.","1)	Reduced disease burden in rural and urban areas

Water plays a critical role in employment and wealth creation, enhancement of Uganda’s competitiveness and in fostering socio-economic transformation. Uganda has already integrated SDGs in its National Development Plan whose implementation has already started. SDG6 indicators have already been integrated in the revised water and environmental sector performance monitoring framework in Uganda and the country will be reporting formally on the revised framework regularly. 
Uganda has however faced several challenges and pressures, such as high population growth, environmental degradation, pollution, climate variability and change, among others. Uganda was also hard hit by the impact of COVID-19 Pandemic, locust invasion and  Ebola which are still impacting negatively the country. The war in neighboring South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo  and Somalia have also greatly affected the country resulting into an influx of almost 1.5 million refugees. The  refugee influx has increased the demand for social services including WASH services. Uganda has however played a pioneering role through the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework (CRRF) to address the refugee crisis caused by conflicts and environment and climate change challenges. Financing has also continued to go down with very few development partners coming in to support the sector. This has therefore made it difficult to achieve the targets of the Water Action Decade. 
While it is quite clear that by investing in the sustainable management of water resources, the world will be scoring on almost all the SDGs; and while also it is clear that water is at the centre of survival, adaptation and mitigation of the effects of climate change, water has not taken centre stage in the financing agenda of Uganda.  With regard to SDGs, the role played by the UN-Water, in the work towards the 2030 Agenda and its dedicated goal on water and sanitation (SDG 6) remains critical.  The methodologies for monitoring SDG 6 indicators underwent piloting in 2016 in a number of countries including Uganda.  The piloting informed finalization of the methodologies that are under implementation to enable the establishment of a baseline for SDG 6 indicators and progressively report on the achievement of SDG6 targets.  While momentum has been set in Uganda to fast track implementation of the various SDG6 targets and set a baseline, a lot of technical and financial support is still needed to enable reporting on all the SDG6 indicators. 
In order to move the Water Action Decade forward there is need to strengthen partnerships and collaboration through ongoing initiatives such as the Program based approach to planning and implementation under the National Development Plan; catchment-based planning, development and management of water and related resources; annual Uganda Water and Environment Weeks, and a number of other programs under the Water Resources Institute","1)	Partnerships and collaboration strengthened through ongoing initiatives such as the Program based approach to planning and implementation under the National Development Plan; catchment-based planning, development and management of water and related resources; annual Uganda Water and Environment Weeks, and a number of other programs under the Water Resources Institute.

When water is scarce, sewage systems can fail and the threat of contracting diseases like cholera surges. Scarce water also becomes more expensive. and bold action needed for a water-secure Africa.
Initiation of Water Conservation
Our initiative  aims to construct and protect dam catchments with good ground cover and maintain a grassed filter strip at the dam inlet. Clean troughs regularly. Establish windbreaks adjacent to dams to reduce evaporation. Construct sediment traps to protect dams during high risk periods. A dam in community will be a structure built across a stream or river to hold water back. These dams can be used to store water, control floods, and generate electricity. Humans as youth will have to  learn how to conserve and effectively utilise freshwater by constructing dams in the nation
.
Our slogan for water conservation
Never waste even a drop of water. No water, no life. No blue, no green. Hold our grip and stop that drip.
 Objectives:
Water conservation objectives need to protect natural water bodies and their aquatic environments. These objectives relate to the volume and quality of water to remain in rivers for the protection of a natural water body and its aquatic environment to increase aquatic animals production and food production through irrigation. During the wet season, saving rainwater can help top up our water supply for plants, cleaning, and flushing the toilet.
 Implementation methodologies
The ways to save water and prevent water scarcity in Africa (Togo):
-Sustainable water management. Improving water infrastructure must be a priority, as water conservation and efficiency are key components of sustainable water management
-Reclaimed water
-Pollution control & better sewage treatment
-Awareness & Education.
We need to follow the sustainable lifestyle of our ancestors and practice the '4Rs' of water conservation -- Reduce, Reuse, Recycle and Replenish
Follow-up mechanisms
Despite the importance of internal follow-up of completed projects to ensure sustainability of water and sanitation initiatives, it is usually a neglected component in the planning process. Follow-up will be part of the monitoring and evaluation phase, which is carried out together with the stakeholders and end-beneficiaries, but it will be an ultimate responsibility of the implementing agency or organisation (e.g. project team and communities' teams). Here, we will find key information on how to supervise implemented projects in a simple and effective way, how to take advantages of the lessons learned from past experiences for the design of spin-off projects.
i) Overexploitation of underground water results in the lowering of water table. ii) The loss of vegetation causes drought and reduction of rainfall. iii) Irrigation utilises more than 90% of the total fresh water.
Governance
Improving governance can help with water conservation in a number of ways: Improved access to information allows consumers and water managers to make more effective decisions. Participation by stakeholders and users increases buy-in to water conservation initiatives.","The initiative had a positive impact which resulted into overall holistic development of the villages and communities.

-Link the SDGs to each other.
-Transcend innovation bubbles
Expected impact
It is found that three variables; runoff coefficient, roof catchment area and number of sources of water were significant on water conservation independently
Managers and other stakeholders including donors  knew the extent to which their projects are meeting their objectives and leading to their desired effects
Follow-up built greater transparency and accountability in terms of use of project resources;
Internal follow-up alerted managers to actual and potential project weaknesses, problems and shortcomings before it is too late;
Future planning and programme development is improved when guided by lessons learned from experience;
Successful implemented project served as reference for future applications for funds;
 Saved money on our power bills by using less energy to heat and pump water. Delay or prevent expansion of costly water and wastewater treatment plants in each our community which  saved money on taxes. Reduced water shortage frequency and impacts.

            Tailored training and technical support delivered to Arab States on the preparation of evidence-based project pipelines on climate finance for water, including national, regional and multi-country projects",Arab States and stakeholders in the water and climate sectors.,"Algeria, Bahrain, Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Somalia, State of Palestine, Sudan, Syrian Arab Republic, Tunisia, United Arab Emirates, Yemen","Africa, West Asia","Climate finance for the water sector was identified as a priority accelerator at the Arab Regional Preparatory Meeting for the Midterm Comprehensive Review of the Water Action Decade (Beirut, May 2022). The meeting highlighted the importance of climate finance for adaptation related to water and that funding should target areas most vulnerable to climate change. The initiative builds regional capacity to mobilize finance for water action under a changing climate. This objective supports regional and global commitments to increase adaptation finance so that it becomes on par with mitigation finance. This is particularly relevant for the water-scarce Arab region where only one-third of international public climate finance flows are directed towards adaptation. Arab States have also repeatedly emphasized the importance of adaptation in the water sector and water-dependent sectors in their nationally determined contributions and in their national and sectoral policies and plans. The initiative supports the Arab Strategy for Water Security in the Arab Region to Meet the Challenges and Future Needs for Sustainable Development 2010-2030 and its action plan, as adopted by the Arab Ministerial Water Council. Specifically, the initiative responds to the axes of work on climate change and water sector financing. The initiative draws upon efforts to institute a science-based approach for targeting water actions at the regional, national and watershed levels, as supported by the Regional Initiative for the Assessment of Climate Change Impacts on Water Resources and Socio-Economic Vulnerability in the Arab Region (RICCAR), which is coordinated by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) in collaboration with the Arab Centre for the Study of Arid and Drylands (ACSAD), Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and other partners in support of the Arab Strategy for Water Security. The AIM Climate Finance for Water Initiative also builds on FAO’s Water Scarcity Initiative (WSI), which supports member countries to pursue water and food security for sustainable development under mounting water scarcity and climate-related risks. RICCAR and WSI are supported by the Swedish Government. The initiative complements efforts pursed under the auspices of the Council of Arab Ministers Responsible for the Environment (CAMRE) to prepare an Arab States Climate Finance Access and Mobilization Strategy, which is being facilitated by the League of Arab States, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and ESCWA. It also draws upon practical guidelines prepared by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) on designing water-climate resilient projects to support water security. The initiative responds to an ESCWA Committee on Water Resources recommendation to strengthen member States’ capacities in scientific, policy and financial tools for mainstreaming climate considerations in development planning, budgeting and financing. This is supported by work on climate mainstreaming undertaken by the Islamic Development Bank (IsDB) and ESCWA, which complements the regional climate change capacity building activities supported by the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFESD), and their respective green projects programmes. Collectively, these efforts provide the knowledge base for this Arab Initiative for Mobilizing Climate Finance for Water.","As stated in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, public finance, both domestic and international, will play a vital role in providing essential services and catalysing other sources of finance. Climate finance can help to foster integrated water resources management and transboundary water cooperation under a changing climate and support efforts to scale up climate-smart practices across water-related sectors. Interventions include climate-smart irrigation techniques, investments in non-conventional water resources, water efficiency and conservation improvements, and efforts to establish effective future-proof systems for rainwater harvesting and water reuse that advance adaptation and support mitigation co-benefits. Mobilizing public sector finance is important for ensuring water for all in a sector where the right to water and sanitation needs to be upheld despite the significant financial constraints facing Arab States. The Arab region suffers from US$1.4 trillion in debt, which is reducing the fiscal space available for joint water and climate actions where cost recovery is more difficult to achieve in the short term. This requires improved access to concessional finance and grants to support water projects that can help countries adapt to the increasing impacts of climate change. This is particularly the case of the six Least Developed Countries that receive just five per cent of climate finance flows to the region. Blended finance, private sector engagement and well-designed business models are needed as well. Mobilizing finance for water projects under a changing climate requires well-informed targeting of interventions that can support water security with respect to freshwater resources and water-dependent sectors, including agriculture, ecosystems, energy and health. Building capacities to develop the climate rationale for water investments can help to unlock access to global, regional and multilateral funds and financial institutions that aim to expand their climate resilient investments and achieve balance between their mitigation and adaptation portfolios. It also requires improved capacity for costing adaptation and demonstrating the benefits and cost savings generated by water and water-related projects in the short, medium and long term under projected climate scenarios and given disaster risks. Increased capacity in developing bankable and affordable project pipelines that respond to national needs can strengthen national commitments and sectoral strategies for mobilizing finance. The initiative engages a range of stakeholders in the identification and targeting of water projects for climate finance in Arab States. Special focus will be placed on fostering opportunities for multi-country and transboundary basin projects that support water cooperation under climate change. FAO’s inter-Regional Platform on Water Scarcity (iRTP-WS) and Climate Change Knowledge Hub can play a role in pooling expertise from other regions. ESCWA’s Arab Centre for Climate Change Policies and the RICCAR Regional Knowledge Hub will leverage knowledge resources and partnerships within the Arab region for advancing the initiative. High level engagement and guidance will be provided through the Arab Ministerial Water Council, the Council for Arab Ministers Responsible for the Environment and their constituent members.",Partners: • League of Arab States – Technical Secretariat of the Arab Ministerial Water Council (AMWC) and Technical Secretariat of the Council of Arab Ministers Responsible for the Environment (CAMRE) • Islamic Development Bank (ISDB) • Green Climate Fund (GCF) • Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) • Government of Sweden • United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA) Collaborating institutions: • Arab Centre for the Study of Arid and Drylands (ACSAD) of the League of Arab States • Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development (AFSED),"Goal 6, Goal 13, Goal 17","6.4, 6.5, 13.1, 13.2, 17.3","Mon, 05/01/2023 - 12:00","Wed, 12/31/2025 - 12:00",• Arab Regional Preparatory Meeting for the Midterm Comprehensive Review of the Water Action Decade (https://www.unescwa.org/events/arab-regional-preparatory-meeting-midterm-comprehensive-review-water-action-decade) • Climate Finance needs and flows in the Arab Region – ESCWA (https://www.unescwa.org/publications/climate-finance-needs-flows-arab-region) • Towards COP27: Arab Regional Forum on Climate Finance (https://www.unescwa.org/events/towards-cop27-arab-regional-forum-climate-finance) • Arab Ministerial Water Council and Council of Arab Ministers Responsible for the Environment – League of Arab States (http://www.lasportal.org) • Regional Initiative for the Assessment of Climate Change Impacts on Water Resources and Socio-Economic Vulnerability in the Arab Region (RICCAR) (https://www.riccar.org) • Sectoral guide: Water security – Green Climate Fund (https://www.greenclimate.fund/document/sectoral-guide-water-security) • Arab States Climate Finance Access and Mobilization Strategy – UNFCCC Needs Based Finance Project (https://unfccc.int/news/working-to-close-the-climate-finance-gap-in-the-arab-region) • Sectoral guide: Water security – Green Climate Fund (https://www.greenclimate.fund/document/sectoral-guide-water-security) • Arab States Climate Finance Access and Mobilization Strategy – UNFCCC Needs Based Finance Project (https://unfccc.int/news/working-to-close-the-climate-finance-gap-in-the-arab-region) • Islamic Development Bank – Climate Change (https://www.isdb.org/climate-change) • Water Scarcity Initiative – FAO (https://www.fao.org/neareast/perspectives/water-scarcity/es) • Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development – Green Projects Program (https://www.arabfund.org/Default.aspx?pageId=54) • Arab Centre for the Study of Arid and Drylands (https://acsad.org/en) • Arab Centre for Climate Change Policies – ESCWA (https://www.unescwa.org/acccp ),0.25,0.4444444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0

As the Netherlands, we want to take this basis more into account when deciding whether to design and spatially plan our country.
Water and soil have a major impact on our daily lives. We get our drinking water from the soil. The soil provides solidity, as a foundation for our roads and houses. Is the soil too wet or too dry? Then we notice this in lower yields, damage to nature or in the supermarket at higher prices.
Every piece of soil and surface water in our country is in use, sometimes for many purposes at the same time. And not just what you see. Also underground it is a hustle and bustle. Pipes, pipes, cables, extraction of raw materials. We have to take better care of our soil. By allowing water and soil to guide spatial planning, we can continue to live, live and work in the Netherlands in the future with a different and capricious climate. In a safe environment, with a healthy soil, sufficient and clean water. We make structuring choices that provide direction for the coming decades. Many choices can and must already be implemented in measures. By making choices now, we can also indicate how we want to deal with long-term developments.

The plan aims to better understand the major challenge of water management as a political issue, at all levels. This starts at the regional and local levels through a more open, efficient and readable governance.","The plan aims to redefine the French water management policy to adapt it to the triple planetary crisis - climate change, pollution, and biodiversity loss - thanks to a more resilient and concerted system promoting water savings, with an adapted and inclusive governance. To achieve this objective, the plan covers key issues : 1. Ensure anticipation, mitigation and adaptation to climate change: The plan sets a target of 10% reduction in water abstraction by 2030. To achieve this goal, water efficiency plans will be set up for all economic sectors this year and more funding will be allocated to water-efficient agricultural practices. Communication and public awareness efforts, including among children, will be undertaken to move towards a reduced use of water resources. Planning will be done at all levels, in particular at the local level, with the implementation of a climate change adaptation plan for each catchment area. Finally, measures aim to improve the management of drought crises by emphasising information and prevention, and implementing decision-making tools at national and local levels. 2. Ensure sufficient water for people and nature: The plan aims to reduce water leaks and secure the supply in clean water, to value non-conventional water (reuse of treated used water, rainwater, and grey water), to improve soil and groundwater storage, especially by preserving wetlands. 3. Ensure water of appropriate quality for people and nature: Measures are taken to 1/ Fight against all forms of pollution in aquatic areas through the reinforcement of the protection of drinking water catchment areas. Agricultural pollution is in particular targeted with measures to foster agro-ecology and biological farming in those areas and a sustainable use of pesticides (at the European level with the future regulation, and at the national level with the phytopharmaceuticals planning - Ecophyto2030). 2/ Restore the large water cycle thanks to the development of nature based solution to restore healthy and functioning ecosystems. 4. Implement the appropriate means to encourage water savings and efficiency in water uses: The following action will allow an effective implementation of the plan: 1/ Improvement of the water management governance in terms of inclusivity, efficiency and readability to ensure a fair share of water resources. 2/ Allocation of appropriate funding: Among key measures, water agencies’ budgets will be increased and additional investments will be mobilised for Oversea territories. Work will also be undertaken on progressive water pricing and research and innovation will be developed (Explore 2 on hydrological projections, prospective studies on the evolution of water demand in France, OneWater, Water4all…).","Regional and local authorities, basin organizations.","Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 4, Goal 6, Goal 8, Goal 9, Goal 11, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 14, Goal 15","2.4 , 3.9, 4.7, 6.1 , 6.3, 6.4, 6.6, 6.b , 8.4, 9.4, 9.5, 11.5, 11.7, 11.a, 11.b, 12.2, 12.4, 12.8, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 14.1, 14.2, 15.1, 15.3, 15.5, 15.9","Thu, 03/30/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 01/01/2030 - 12:00",https://www.ecologie.gouv.fr/plan-action-gestion-resiliente-et-concertee-eau,0.625,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05494505494505515

City briefs for 3 cities including specific learnings and recommendations for further steps in risk management linked to SDGs and resilience metrics",Member cities of the Resilient Cities Network,Global,"Africa, Europe, Asia and Pacific, North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, Global","Climate change is primarily a water crisis. A changing climate coupled with rapid urbanization has resulted in unpredictable rainfall, flooding, droughts and other water-related shocks and stresses on cities. With over 2 billion new urban citizens anticipated by 2050, cities increasingly recognize the need for better understanding of the water-related risks. Decision makers are demanding data and tools that will help them assess these risks and prioritize action and investments that will help their cities become more resilient. They focus on the central role water plays in the life of cities looking for innovation and best practice to replicate and scale.
Improving the quality, transparency, and accessibility of risk information particularly for cities located in developing countries or data poor environments are central to improving urban water management. Cities are eager to develop their own capacity to both anticipate and mitigate water-related shocks and stresses. They are looking for guidance, recommendations, and best practices to access risk information and data enabling decision makers to develop policy and accelerate action that reduce existing risks and avoid the creation of new risks. Cities need to better understand risk to plan, decide and invest in the right way to advance the urban transformation needed to build more resilient and future-ready communities and local economies.
Therefore, Deltares and Resilient Cities Network are launching Water Action Towards Urban Resilience (WATUR). WATUR evolves from the organizations’ longstanding and trusted partnership and their complementary and mutually reinforcing roles as a city network and a research institute in driving urban resilience and water action. 
The overall objective of WATUR is to enable cities to better understand and assess existing and future water risks and improve their ability of risk-aware planning and decision making. 
WATUR will connect cities to state of the art research and solutions, technical experts, facilitate peer-to-peer learning and help cities gain access to high quality and reliable data and tools that allow them to advance their resilience building efforts. To sustainably improve urban water management, cities need to understand that not all types of risk are equal and plan and act accordingly. Risk levels may be different and vary over time, and may affect services, infrastructure, people, or ecosystems differently depending on activities and action taken.
In 2023, Deltares and R-Cities together with a selected number of cities and interested partners and funders will focus on a preliminary set of activities as well as on securing funding for continuous capacity and project development support for cities in the Global South up to 2030.","The Program will build capacity in cities through training and mentoring, the combination and use of existing resilience tools and the co-development of a risk assessment workflow that will lead to a better understanding of existing and future water and climate-related risks, risk awareness and improved planning and decision making by city governments.
Through bespoke training, mentoring and knowledge exchange sessions, cities will be able to share and articulate their needs while being exposed to state of the art tools, innovative solutions, and best practices. Through the co-development of a risk assessment workflow cities will build their capacity and develop ownership of tools and information. In the long term, WATUR will enable cities to prioritize and accelerate water action based on identified risks and vulnerabilities and a high resilience value.
The partners will provide technical and engagement support to mobilize city officials, partners and funders to scale game-changing initiatives identified. Best practices and solutions will be captured and disseminated through R-Cities’ knowledge and practice hub.
WATUR will provide a platform for resilience practitioners to connect to researchers, technical experts and their peers, forge coalitions and partnerships, strengthen capacities to understand risk and identify risk-aware solutions. It will strengthen existing resilience assessment approaches to accelerate water action with a clear target to advance the urban transformation needed to guarantee resilient and future-ready communities and sustainable local economies.",Resilient Cities Network,"Goal 3, Goal 6, Goal 9, Goal 11, Goal 13, Goal 17",,"Sun, 01/01/2023 - 12:00","Sun, 12/31/2023 - 12:00",Not available,0.0,0.4444444444444444,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

Displacement leads to particular vulnerabilities, including limited access to water and sanitation infrastructure. Lack of access to water and sanitation can become a source of inter and intra-community conflict, accentuated by climate change. Given the chronic and prolonged nature of internal displacement, the emergency response must be accompanied by actions to prevent new crises and the search for sustainable solutions, adopting a development-oriented approach and favoring long-term actions."," SIF aims to systematize this development approach to emergency projects in order to implement sustainable solutions for displaced populations and host communities. Various projects with this sustainable approach are developed by SIF for IDPs. For example, in 2021 and 2022 in Syria, the rehabilitation of a non-functional canal since 2012 in the rural area of Aleppo was implemented. This project benefited 123,983 returned beneficiaries. The rehabilitation of the canal over a 34 km stretch has allowed: to regulate water supply to farmers in order to increase agricultural yields; to improve livelihoods and business opportunities for targeted communities by encouraging displaced households to return to their farms; to mitigate the risks of negative coping strategies of the displaced and to decrease protection risks (e.g. repetitive displacement, children out of school, high poverty, conflicts...). Rehabilitation of other portions of the canal is planned for 2023 with support from UNHCR and OCHA. In Somalia, a project to strengthen the livelihoods and resilience of crisis-affected IDP, returnee, and host communities in Puntland and Jubaland states was implemented in 2020 with Vets Without Borders and funded by BMZ. The outcomes are: - affected communities - 2,083 HH, 12,498 people - improved resilience to current hazards and shocks, access to basic services through functional WASH and health infrastructure, and DRR preparedness and response mechanisms (incl. NRM, DRM); - Water supply and WASH infrastructure in 1 hospital and 3 schools serving IDPs are rehabilitated/constructed for improved hygiene. - A peacebuilding component is carried out with existing community structures, building the capacity of village and district peace committees and linking them to government structures. Members are sensitized to peace building and conflict transformation, including conflicts over natural resource management. This project is part of a triple nexus approach and thus avoids repetitive displacement of target populations and conflicts between host communities and displaced people. We try to implement this type of approach in our projects whose beneficiary targets are displaced persons, returnees and host communities.","local actors, and international NGO","Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 8, Goal 13, Goal 16",,,,"Forum humanitaire européen 2023 – Crise déplacés internes – Secours Islamique (secours-islamique.org)

Access to gasoline is increasingly problematic and is very harmful for the environment. This is the reason why SIF’s ambition is to develop continuous access to clean energy (SDG7) in countries of intervention.
For example, a bio-saline farm project was implemented in Pakistan. SIF has implemented a Nexus Water-Energy-Food (WEFe) project. The installation of solar panels has reduced the difficulty of accessing the resource by setting up autonomous wells, reduced the time spent for women collecting water.Supplemented by a drip system to water plants and trees resistant to high salinity, the production has improved household food security.

Climate crisis and prolonged conflicts requires bringing sustainable solutions to beneficiaries in continuous emergencies.","Throughout these interventions, SIF aims to:
•	Reduce the difficulty of accessing the resource by setting up autonomous wells
•	Reduce the time spent collecting water and reduce the waiting line and therefore the associated conflicts; but also allow women to devote themselves to other tasks and allow children to go to school
•	Allow continuous access to water homes subject to recurrent power cuts
•	Develop mini water supply systems in rural villages thanks to autonomous wells allowing the installation of several sampling points
•	Provide solar lighting (such as street lights, latrines, in schools or at household level) to enhance safety of the population, especially women and children
•	Reduce the risk of fire and the impact of women’s health by providing solar cooking equipment (reducing deforestation, gaining time for women as well and improved stove with better thermal efficiency)

Germany faces increasing pressure on its water resources. The last few summers of drought have had a serious impact on forests, agriculture, inland waterway transport and biodiversity in Germany. Already early in March 2023, neighboring countries such as France and Italy reported about a winter drought, forecasting another dry year. By contrast, almost two years ago, water masses in the Ahr valley and in North Rhine-Westphalia caused a devastating flood disaster. These extremes threaten to become a new normality as a result of the climate crisis. At the same time, water management in Germany is still facing serious challenges. Despite progress made, Germany needs to modernize and adapt its water infrastructure, protect its water bodies, ensure responsible management and use of available water resources, and to make the water sector climate-smart and resilient for the future. 
To this end, the German Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Nuclear Safety and Consumer Protection (BMUV) developed in close cooperation with other relevant ministries the first National Water Strategy (NWS), which was adopted by the Federal Cabinet on 15 March 2023. It is partly based on the results of a two-year National Water Dialogue and a participatory and inclusive citizens’ dialogue on water. For the first time, all relevant stakeholders are involved, both in the development and in the implementation of the NWS: the federal-, state-, and local governments, the water industry, all water-using economic sectors, associations, experts and citizens.
The NWS addresses the challenges of the water sector in Germany up to the year 2050. It describes ten strategic areas and sets a vision and aspired goals to address them over the coming 30 years. The 10 strategic areas are broken down into an action program of 78 concrete measures that will be implemented step by step, through a mix of funding, legal regulations, knowledge-building and dialogue. For the first time, the NWS bundles water-related measures in all relevant sectors: agriculture and nature conservation, administration and transport, urban development, and industry.","The NWS is a milestone in the transformation of the German water sector. Through the NWS, stakeholders contribute to the restoration of the natural water balance and climate-resilience of the water sector in the near and long-term future. The expected impact (mission) of the NWS until 2050 is that the protection of natural water resources and the sustainable use of water in times of global transformation have been implemented in all areas of life and the economy in Germany for the benefit of people and the environment.
The NWS will contribute to the implementation of SDG 6 by implementing action-oriented measures in the following ten strategic areas:  
1.	Protect, restore, and ensure a semi-natural water regime for the long term – prevent water scarcity and conflicting goals
2.	Ensure that land use in rural and urban areas is compatible with water bodies and adapted to the climate
3.	Further develop sustainable management of water bodies – achieve and preserve good status
4.	Mitigate risks caused by pollutants
5.	Further develop water infrastructure adapted to the climate – protect against extreme events and ensure supply
6.	Link water, energy, and substance cycles
7.	Strengthen efficient administrations, improve data flows, optimise legal frameworks and secure financing

Uganda is both an upstream and a downstream country in the Nile Basin and as such transboundary water cooperation is not an option but a must.
Accordingly, Uganda has since 1960s acted as a moderator of downstream-upstream dialogue and played a key role in the finalization and signing of the Nile Basin Cooperative Framework Agreement (CFA) and has been engaging other countries in the basin to resolve the disagreements over the Cooperative Framework Agreement.
Uganda finalized the ratification of the CFA and this confirmed the country’s commitment to transboundary cooperation and harmonious co-existence in its over 50 year long history of participating in transboundary water discussions. Its hosting of the Nile Basin Initiative (NBI) for the past 20 years and the hosting of the first ever Nile Basin Heads of State Summit in June 2017 in Entebbe is further testimony to the priority given to transboundary water cooperation.
While transboundary water cooperation in the Nile River basin currently happens on a good faith basis, a legally binding framework would provide opportunities to strengthen this cooperation and move it further forward. The provisions of the Nile Basin Cooperative Framework Agreement are largely drawn from the 1992 Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes in Europe (UNECE Water Convention) and the 1997 UN Convention on the Law of the Non-Navigational uses of International Watercourses (UN Watercourses Convention).
With Uganda ratifying the CFA the country is in the process of acceding to the two Conventions. Despite Uganda not being a party to the Water Convention it has been actively involved in activities under the Convention such as:
(i)	Reporting on Sustainable Development Goal 6 and particularly its target 6.5.2 dealing with transboundary water cooperation
(ii)	Implementing a project on strengthening transboundary water cooperation between Kenya and Uganda and identifying joint transboundary investment projects  for funding.
(iii)	Participating in a number of meetings and workshops organized by UNECE.
(iv)	Co-organizing an international water law and governance training course at the Water Resources Institute in Uganda in 2018, 2019 and 2022.
Two briefing workshops about the two Conventions were held in 2019 and 2022 and facilitated by UNECE. The workshops highlighted the benefits that would drawn from  being party, the obligations of being a member as well as the accession procedures.  Through these two workshops key stakeholders in the country became aware of the two conventions, the benefits and obligations of Uganda being a party, and agreed on the road map for the accession process including the establishment of an inter-ministerial committee to support  accession process to the global water conventions. The road map is being implemented with ratification documents and ratification arguments to support Uganda’s accession process prepared. This commitment is therefore aimed at fast tracking accession to the Water Conventions by September 2023 and operationalizing the provisions of the Water Convention after the accession process.","•	The country will demonstrate to other Nile riparian states and other stakeholders its commitment to transboundary water cooperation and the need to operationalize the Nile Basin Cooperative Framework Agreement
•	Accession to the UN Water Conventions will be promoted among other Nile Basin States

•	nature-based solutions, rainwater harvesting, decentralized aquifer recharge and storage, and natural sequence farming practices to successfully sustain and navigate the task of producing food, fiber, and biomass while stewards of natural assets.
•	regenerative agriculture, rewilding practices, permaculture, agroforestry, agroecology, and guidance by indigenous wisdom
•	blue-and-green-infrastructure, low-impact urban development, and redesigning cities to reduce heat island effects.

•	nature conservation with the understanding that Earth's boundaries and capacity for self-regulation are severely stressed in the anthropogenic era, and humans can play a vital role in ecological restoration, reinstating the system.
•	floodplain and riparian restoration, and more...
Nature-based solutions focused on rainwater conservation offer a pathway to tackle many threats of climate change: droughts, floods, carbon sequestration, heat stress, soil fertility, and biodiversity loss. Understanding, assessing, and valuing rainwater management benefits will offer prospects to foster community collaboration in scaling up effective rainwater retention measures to restore global terrestrial water cycles. 
Paradoxically, in current water management, we focus on a large water cycle, visible water, and rainfall distribution based on oceanic moisture transport. In a small water cycle, we observe the human alterations of the land use and land cover (LULC) and the related evapo-transpiration and precipitation feedback loop. Vegetation, soil moisture, and natural or constructed wetlands regenerate horizontal precipitation and local rainfall with multiple benefits of plant water vapor, soil water infiltration, and biotic pump.
A novel 'biotic pump' theory suggests that evaporation and condensation can influence atmospheric dynamics and explains how sizeable, vegetated land masses and wetlands maintain regular rainfall. Precipitation feedback within many of these processes can result in dramatic change potential due to forest loss (or gain), reversing from a wet to a dry local climate.
Holding the rainwater where it falls is the key solution to stopping the drying of continents and rising ocean levels. A new blue-and-green infrastructure integrated management will renew terrestrial water cycles, thus soil fertility, and return water to the continents and continents. 
In the holistic concept of the water-energy-food-ecology nexus, we speak about water cycles modified by humans. We discuss the role of water and plants in the distribution of solar energy. Plants store water. Solar energy transformation by water retention measures must be integrated into regional, national, and global decision-making on climate change mitigation and land use management policies. Individuals, local stakeholders, and public administration should actively participate in implementing soil adaptation, watershed management measures, and integrated rainwater utilization. If managed up to scale, the integrated regional restoration plans will relatively shortly restore water, food, environmental, and climate security at the regional levels.  The water cycle's stability depends on land use, the soil's health and moisture content, rain, and vegetation.","Each square meter or acre of land impacts on the total area of the continents of 136 million km2 (excluding ice cover) in terms of climate stability and water circulation.
Our action plan challenges the UNEP to formulate a protocol for evaluating the key indicators of soil health and climate stability. Soil health and climate stability depend on land use and land cover. 
LULC (land use and land cover) management directly affects our climate. Redesigning and retrofitting all landscapes (urban, farming, forested, and other) must incorporate the role of vegetation, wetlands, soil moisture, and water in solar energy dissipation. Plants store water and affect the water cycle. Land use and land cover affect the health of watersheds and the water cycle. Healthy watersheds determine water-energy-food-ecology nexus; economic recovery, biodiversity resilience and human health.
Key climate stability indicators of soil health need to include:
the rainwater retention capacity of soil and landscape structures/ water infiltration rate (depending on the geology, the density of vegetation, soil compaction, and stormwater runoff);
decentralized groundwater recharge assessment from rainwater for different watersheds;
agrochemical parameters of the soil;
the vegetation cover and density assessment;
soil erosion factors;
soil sealing rate; (LULC - land use, land cover)
the soil's organic material content;
soil carbon sequestration rates
sensible heat assessment of the area and its correlation to the LULC.
These indicators need to be evaluated on an annual basis, as well as their trends.
The goal for each and every community or country is to capture minimum 200 m3 per one hectare of land.
Every raindrop that will be slowed, sunk, or stored wil provide these benefitsl:
Recharge the groundwater
Create water resources
Increase evapotranspiration, returning water to the small water cycle
Cool our environment, especially in our cities
Promote local rainfall feedback loop
Increase soil fertility and crop yield
Sustain nature and people
Support biodiversity
Result in economic recovery, reducing flood risk, and helping prevent droughts
Building new green-blue-rainwater infrastructure will create new jobs and reduce unemployment.","Ministry of the Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic

            The Dakar Action Plan for IWRM at the basin level","Local population, small and medium enterprises from water related sectors, civil society,",France,"Africa, Asia and Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean","France is supporting diverse local projects, at regional, basin or international level, aiming to enhance the integrated water resources management for a sustainable development and resilience of populations most vulnerable to environmental degradation and climate change.
Through various partnerships with least developed and developing countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia, France lead various initiatives to facilitate the development of projects enabling a balanced used of water between sectors, for a resilient rural development, the transition toward agro-ecology, and adaptation to climate change.
These initiatives in countries the most affected by climate change, is consistent with France commitment in the Dakar Action Plan for IWRM at the basin level.","With this commitment, France expects to contribute to the implementation worldwide of an integrate approach to water management, between relevant sectors, to enhance the rural development, the resilience, and climate change adaptation, while ensuring the durability of water resources. To this aim, France leads 3 main initiatives : 
1.	The Great Green Wall Accelerator in the Sahara and Sahel region: it enables to redefine and accelerate the implementation of the regional strategy against desertification, by developing a patchwork of rural development project from Dakar to Djibouti. The sustainable management of underground water resources is at the heart of many projects by enhancing recharge capabilities, sustainable use of underground resources, or preservation of underground water quality. Hence, the Accelerator favors the development of projects implementing agro-ecology or reforestation, in line with 3 of its main pillars: land restoration and sustainable ecosystem management (Pillar 2), climate-resilient infrastructure and access to renewable energy (Pillar 3), and capacity building (Pillar 5).
2.	The COSTEA (Le Comité Scientifique et Technique de l’Eau Agricole / the Scientific and Technical Commitee for Water in Agriculture) : it contribute to support in 14 countries in Africa, Latin America and Asia, political and technical decision on managing water resources in agriculture, facing climate change while ensuring food security. The COSTEA aim to produce knowledge and share experiences between actors from developing countries and France, in particular concerning climate models simulating temperature, rainfall and water resources at the local level, making it possible to inform the countries' agricultural policies, the design of hydro-agricultural facilities, the management of irrigation, and the evolution of production models. Financed by AFD and created in partnership with the French Association for Water, Irrigation and Drainage (AFEID), COSTEA, through the production of knowledge on agro-ecology in irrigated systems or the reinforcement of the capacities of Irrigation Development and Management Companies in West Africa, is directly involved in the Great Green Wall Accelerator.
3.	“Water and climate"" projects incubator: it aims to bring together donors and stakeholders to operationalize and accelerate the development of project linking water and climate action. This incubator is the extension in new regions of the initiative “100 Water and Climate Projects for Africa” launched by France with the International Office for Water (OiEau) in 2017 at the One Planet Summit. It aims to strengthen water governance and the development of climate adaptation strategies, through 1/  identification and development of project proposals, 2/ technical support to meet climate finance requirements, 3/ resource mobilization through identification of donors. In order to reach SDG 6 targets, the projects incubated concern mainly knowledge development, governance, capacity building and nature-based solutions.","Multiple including OiEau, AFD, AFEID,","Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 6, Goal 13, Goal 15","6.3, 6.4, 6.5","Fri, 01/01/2021 - 12:00","Tue, 01/01/2030 - 12:00",,0.375,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05494505494505515

SIF welcomes the commitments of the french governement to support the appointment of a UN water special envoy with a strong political mandate to steer the United Nations’ reflections on international water governance. We also welcome the governement’s commitment to advocate for regular international meetings on water.  SIF will monitor the french governement commitments, and we will also push for the inclusion of a « freshwater » segment in the United Nations Oceans Conference, which France has committed to hosting, along with Costa Rica, in 2025. - Supporting the Call to Action for survival and resilient WASH Humanitarian WASH actors do not have capacity and resources to respond to the ever growing-needs and demands. Indeed, humanitarian funds dedicated to the WASH sector represented only 21% of the amount requested during Humanitarian Response Plans. This is particularly worrying when the total amount of people in need is increasing every year, from 80 million in 2013 to 339 million in 2023. The WASH Road map organisations have developed a call to action for UN member states to commit to concrete actions to strengthen the WASH sector in situations of fragility, conflict and violence  SIF has signed this call to action and will disseminate its advocacy messages in its own advocacy, and will join the monitoring efforts of the french WASH road map’s actors towards the french governement who also signed the call to action. - Disseminating advocacy messages from the Water Justice Manifesto The Manifesto urges governmental decision-makers to recognise that water and sanitation are fundamental human rights and centre the demands of right-holders in decisions about water and sanitation in their countries. It also calls for states to recognise and support community water and sanitation management practices.  SIF has signed the Water justice manifesto and will disseminate its advocacy messages in its own advocacy. - Implementing a nexus water energy food approach in SIF programs The countries in which SIF operates are subject to recurring energy constraints impacting access to WASH. Access to gasoline is increasingly problematic and is very harmful for the environment. SIF’s ambition is to develop continuous access to clean energy (SDG7) in countries of intervention. For example, a bio-saline farm project was implemented in Pakistan. SIF has implemented a Nexus Water-Energy-Food (WEFe) project. The installation of solar panels has reduced the difficulty of accessing the resource by setting up autonomous wells, reduced the time spent for women collecting water.Supplemented by a drip system to water plants and trees resistant to high salinity, the production has improved household food security.  SIF’s objective is to develop WEFe Nexus projects in order to increase the autonomy of the population and decrease the negative impact on the environment. Climate crisis and prolonged conflicts requires bringing sustainable solutions to beneficiaries in continuous emergencies.","The Water Action Agenda is an opportunity to mobilize all stakeholders to work towards reducing existential threats linked to water access and achieving universal access to water and sanitation for all, without any discrimination, while prioritizing those most in need.

            Supporting local and national governments to recognise Rights of Wetlands in specific policies, decision-support frameworks and legislation",All Nature including people,"Macquarie University, Colombia, Ecuador, Guyana, India, Kenya, New Zealand, Spain, Sri Lanka, Ibero-American Network of Life Cycle Assesment",Global,"Wetlands are a key ecosystem for our survival, of unparalleled importance for biodiversity, climate, and ecosystem services - particularly water quantity and quality. Yet wetlands continue to be lost through infilling and drainage for agriculture and urban settlements, and degraded by pollution, alterations to water regimes, fragmentation, climate change, and over-extraction of natural resources. 
Rights of Wetlands recognises that new approaches to how we view and interact with nature are required to address climate destabilisation and biodiversity loss, which pose an existential threat to wildlife, people and planet. Efforts to protect nature through conservation actions and environmental protection are proving insufficient, including for water-related ecosystems that provide freshwater. 
Rights of Wetlands is part of a global Rights of Nature movement, which is transformative and shifts the globally-predominant paradigm that is responsible for endangering the wellbeing and existence of Nature. The Rights of Nature paradigm reconfigures the human-wetlands relationship from one of exploitation, extraction, and depletion to one that recognizes the Rights and living beingness of wetlands, and is based on reciprocity, kinship, and gratitude. 
Rights of Wetlands is about behavioural and systems change through legal frameworks and through how communities and individuals interact with the wetlands they live next to or within.  
Rights of Wetlands declares that all wetlands are entities entitled to inherent and enduring rights, which derive from their existence as members of the Earth community and should possess legal standing in courts of law. These rights include:
1) The right to exist
2) The right to their ecologically determined location in the landscape
3) The right to natural, connected and sustainable hydrological regimes
4) The right to ecologically sustainable climatic conditions
5) The right to have naturally occurring biodiversity, free of introduced or invasive species that disrupt their ecological integrity
6) The right to integrity of structure, function, evolutionary processes and the ability to fulfil natural ecological roles in the Earth’s processes
7) The right to be free from pollution and degradation
8) The right to regeneration and restoration.
RIGHTS OF WETLANDS KEY MESSAGES AND ACTIONS 
Achieving the future wellbeing and sustainability of life on Earth requires rapid and transformative change. 
Recognizing, implementing and ensuring Rights of Wetlands is a critically important transformative change towards aligning human activities with ecological reality.  
Humans have an ethical duty to recognise the Rights of Wetlands and other elements of Nature to exist, to have a place to exist, and to fully participate in the Web of Life. 
The 8 Rights of Wetlands are interconnected. Wetlands can’t exist without all 8 Rights. 
Indigenous Peoples and Local Communities are leaders in recognizing the Rights and living beingness of Nature and the role and responsibilities of humans as members of the Web of Life. 
Legal structures for applying Rights of Nature exist, and they apply to Rights of Wetlands. 
Local communities can take, and are taking, actions to change their relationship with wetlands. 
Rights of Wetlands can be promoted and supported through cultural, educational, legal, and wetland management strategies.","Embedding the Rights of Wetlands to function and exist through community management, legal instruments and governance frameworks is one route to protecting, restoring and sustainably using water resources and wetland ecosystems vital for the provision of freshwater, biodiversity, climate mitigation and adaptation, food security, poverty alleviation, human wellbeing and economic resilience.  
Wetlands make a significant contribute to all of the Sustainable Development Goals (see: Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, ‘Scaling up wetland conservation, wise use and restoration to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals’, 2018) including the following. 
SDG 6 on clean water and sanitation: Almost all of the world’s consumption of freshwater is drawn either directly or indirectly from wetlands.
SDG 13 on climate: Wetlands play a crucial role in climate mitigation by locking up carbon and in adaptation and resilience through climate regulation, storm protection, drought reduction and flood protection. Ensuring that wetlands have the right to exist, the right to natural, connected and sustainable hydrological regimes, the right to be free from pollution and degradation and the right to regeneration and restoration, can form part of climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies.
SDG 15 life on land: halting and reversing biodiversity loss requires new approaches to conservation, restoration, and sustainable development which reshape the human-nature relationship and shift away from consumption-oriented economic approaches that have led us to the brink of catastrophic climate destabilisation and brought on the 6th mass extinction. The Rights of Wetlands is one example of such an approach, addressing what IPBES categorises as indirect drivers of ecosystem loss and degradation, without action on which the Global Biodiversity Framework goals and targets (including those specifically referencing inland waters) will not be achieved. 
SDG 12 on sustainable production and consumption: Placing the Rights of Wetlands at the centre of consumption and production planning will lead to behavioural and systems change that ensures sustainability is achieved particularly in relation to water resource use and protection. As individuals, communities, corporate entities and governments seek to avoid negative impacts on the eight Rights of Wetlands, shifts in consumption and production will play a major part. 
Operationalizing the Rights of Wetlands also contributes to SDG17 due to the partners involved and because of the strong link to the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, which is signed by 172 countries and concerned with the protection, restoration and wise use of all wetlands, including Wetlands of International Importance. The Ramsar Convention on Wetlands is also the focus for long-term collaboration with diverse civil society organisations, local communities, scientists and others with experience and expertise from local to global level, from small scale urban wetlands (linked to SDG 11) to large landscape-scale wetland restoration projects to secure resilient water systems for people and nature.","PROJECT PARTNERS:

            Operational system for rainfall maps over Zambia","Approach can be scaled up to any number of countries and will profit both urban (flood early warnings) and rural (climate-smart agriculture) populations, as well as renewable energy generation.","Benin, Côte d'Ivoire, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Senegal, Togo, Uganda, Zambia",Africa,"The objective is to produce timely and accurate rainfall maps for ten countries in sub-Saharan Africa. These maps will provide flood early warnings, enable climate-smart agriculture, and improve reservoir operations. Present near-real-time rainfall maps over Africa are 100% based on satellite data and are inaccurate to the extent that they have little to no operational value. More accurate maps combine satellite and ground data. Unfortunately, these have a long latency of one month or more, making them not usable for most operational applications. 
The best approach to obtain accuracy in terms of timing, spatial distribution, and amount of rainfall is through an optimal combination of satellite data, ground data, and computer models. In general, ground data are sparse in Africa but, over the past decade, TAHMO has built and has been operating a network of 600+ weather stations in 23 African countries. Using data from these stations, which are available every hour in near-real time, is key to this initiative. Satellite data are still very much needed to interpolate between stations. There are exciting developments, such as Meteosat Third Generation (MTG) which provides meteorologically relevant images of Africa at 500m resolution six times per hour, and the radar-based constellation that tomorrow.io is launching, which provides global coverage once per hour, which will feed this development. Finally, computer models are necessary to tie it all together. Presently, algorithms typically have only one parameterization but with the advent of specialized machine learning, it will be possible to be location and season specific. 
Quantified objectives. In terms of timeliness, we distinguish early products and daily products. Early products will have a latency of one hour and can support implementation of flood early warning systems, especially for urban areas and land-slides. The outputs will be categorical (no rain, normal rain, heavy rain, very heavy rain), according to local climates with a SEEPS score of 80% or better. Daily products will have a higher accuracy (SEEPS>90%, bias < 1 mm/day) and serve larger scale applications, such as hydrological modeling for reservoir management and index-based agricultural drought insurance. Especially insurance demands a high accuracy in terms of rainfall location as farms in Africa tend to be very small. MTG, which is about to become operational, will provide data at 500 m resolution, every ten minutes. A storm tracking approach that has been proven to work in Thailand will be combined with MTG data to have a categorical spatial accuracy of 500m.","Timely and accurate rainfall maps are a necessary condition for improvements of climate-smart agriculture, flood early warning systems, and reservoir operations. Presently, there are satellite-based rainfall maps available but their accuracy over Africa is low with over-estimation of the number of rainfall events, while underestimating the amount of rainfall per event. We are often talking about a difference of a factor two between satellite estimates and ground observations. Over longer periods and larger areas, the results tend to improve although we also see drift in the results once the number of ground stations used is reduced. Several satellite products are bias-corrected with ground stations but the latency of these products often are one month or more, due to the fact that the station data are not available in near-real time.
Presently, TAHMO operates a network of 600+ stations in 23 African countries. In our pilot countries (Kenya, Ghana, Uganda) the network has reached operational densities. Because TAHMO data on rainfall (and other weather variables) are collected at five minute intervals and are communicated every hour, there is a clear opportunity to use TAHMO data to: 1) Improve satellite rainfall products by adjusting algorithms and parameters, and 2) Provide near-real-time bias corrections.
Different applications have different demands in terms of accuracy and timeliness. For flood early warning systems, it may suffice to have categorically correct rainfall estimates (no rain,, normal rain, (very) heavy rain) as long as these estimates are timely. For climate-smart agriculture, accuracy in location is very important. For reservoir management, and large scale hydrological models in general, spatio-temporal distribution and absolute rainfall amounts are crucial. With the proposed approach, all demands can be met for all applications.
Based on estimates by the United Nations of the value of flood early warning systems alone, the proposed measures will have a benefit/cost ratio of more than ten.","National Hydro-Met services

            02 rules and guidelines: one for drainage and rainwater management (regulation of the service provision) and one for urban solid waste management (quality indicators and standards of service provision)",Brazilian population.,Brazil,Latin America and the Caribbean,"According to the United Nations (UN Water), Brazil has been selected as one out of three countries, together with Ghana and Singapore, to be recognized for its acceleration of progress towards the achievement of SDG 6 in 2023. This is the result of action taken by Brazil spanning more than two decades to improve water quality and sustainable access to water resources.
To achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the National Water and Sanitation Agency of Brazil - ANA established series of partnerships focused on technical and financial cooperations. Nowadays, there are several efforts of Brazilian institutions for regulatory harmonization and other initiatives aimed at the universalization of sanitation services proposed by the SDG 6. This includes best practices regarding enforceable policies, laws, regulations, and guidelines that clearly define responsibilities, accountability mechanisms, and resources for planning, execution, and management.
In Brazil, ANA implements the National Water Resources Policy, coordinates the National Water Resources Management System (Singreh) and establishes reference standards to regulate sanitation services, according to new attributes defined by Law no. 14,026 of 2020. SDG 6 indicators are monitored constantly by ANA in partnership with other institutions such as the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).
In the specific case of SDG 6, the analysis process of the different databases, methodological discussions with international custodian agencies and the calculation of its 11 indicators has been led by ANA, which also maintains an interinstitutional articulation for monitoring along with partner institutions and their focal points. The results of this broad and complex work have been disseminated and communicated by ANA, nationally and internationally, in the most simplified and accessible way possible, maintaining an interactive panel on SDG 6 and periodically publishing monitoring reports.
Furthermore, this initiative is in line with the Valuing Water Initiative - VWI, for which ANA plans to subscribe.","In relation to the different SDG 6 targets and the situation in Brazil, it is important to mention that the national reference standards for sanitation are also essential to guide full access to drinking water and sanitation services provided for in targets 6.1 and 6.2, not just from the point of view of infrastructure, but mainly ensuring that it is, in fact, universal and fair. Implementation of the instruments of the national water resources policy, regulated by ANA, are fundamental to targets 6.3 and 6.4, which seek to improve water quality, substantially increase efficiency in its sectoral use and ensure sustainability of the water sources and should be a priority theme on the Agency’s regulatory agenda. Target 6.5 of implementing integrated water resources management in Brazil, including through transboundary cooperation, should be guided by the new National Water Resources Plan, PNRH 2022-2040, organized in programs aimed at strengthening Singreh, the implementation of policy instruments, water quality and quantity management and interfaces with other sectoral policies. Success in implementing the Plan must ensure that the progress observed in this target and sub-indicators 6.a and 6.b is maintained. Actions related to target 6.6, to protect and restore ecosystems related to water, supplement, with green infrastructure and nature-based solutions, the previous items that focus on water resources management and the implementation of gray infrastructure. Due to its importance, Singreh must establish its specific field of action with greater certainty in the interface with environmental policy and management, so as not to be restricted to isolated programs and actions.
The most updated information about SDG 6 in Brazil is available at the 2nd edition of the report “SDG6 in Brazil: ANA’s vision of the Indicators”, published in 2022 and available at https://metadados.snirh.gov.br/geonetwork/srv/api/records/c93c5670-f4a7…","Mission of Brazil to the United Nations (Ministry of Foreign Affairs – MRE)

The Metropolitan Water Resilience Agenda (ARHM) is a response to this, marking the path that must be followed as a metropolis to comprehensively manage water, and strengthens its capacity to better anticipate and prepare for future contingencies.
Its main objective is to improve the water resilience of the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area, strengthening water management, so that it can face the effects of climate change and the socioeconomic challenges that put at risk the sustainable access of the population, the agricultural sector , and industry to water resources. The document includes:
-Diagnosis: Current situation of the city's water system and the challenges it faces.
-Resilience Profile: Identification of areas of opportunity to achieve water resilience.
-Organization of a Social Forum for feedback from the sectors on the Agenda.
-Preparation of the Water Resilience Agenda in the AMG.
Development of 4 strategic projects.
Portfolio of 36 government projects.
Portfolio of projects with academia, organized civil society and the private sector.
-Development of an interactive model of the water system to know the relationship of the different parts of the system and make better decisions.
-Green and blue infrastructure training for public servants.
-International dissemination campaign of the Water Resilience Agenda.
The result is then the route to increase metropolitan resilience, through a portfolio of projects under 5 lines of action. Given the multiplicity of actors and the complexity of the projects that make up the RHA, monitoring is key to achieving the objectives and the implementation of each one of them until its final stage. This translates into permanent accompaniment to the responsible instances by the IMEPLAN, as the metropolitan coordination instance, hand in hand with the government of the state of Jalisco.","The Water Resilience Agenda has a direct impact on the sustainable development goals, specifically goal 6 related to clean water and sanitation. The proposed measures expand access to water to populations with water vulnerability and shortages, through rainwater harvesting programs and the implementation of hydraulic infrastructure (6.4). They also contribute to increasing sanitation, improving water quality as well as its reuse, with actions such as the purple reuse lines, expansion of water treatment plants and the recovery strategy of the Santiago River, the most polluted in Mexico (6.3 and 6.6).Finally, the actions also contribute to the energy sustainability of the extraction.
Additionally, all these measures are related to other SDGs such as goal 9, resilient infrastructure, goal 13 related to climate action, and goal 7, energy sustainability. All this under the logic that the coordinated actions promoted in the water agenda are transversal, and have an impact on various aspects of our environment","Resilient Cities Network

Methodology: Pull initially on the 80+ EU climate pact ambassadors to have specific talks and events on water and climate change.
Follow up: Reporting at the end of the year
Governance: Led by the EU climate pact ambassadors that hosted the event at the EU Delegation in New Yorñ on March 24th 2023
We will build on the work we already presented i.e
The IPCC work on water by Elena Lopez Gunn shows that the impacts of climate change are largely mediated by water. Climate change has affected all components of water cycle and all water use sectors in all regions, most Impacts are negative. Water is central to adaptation ~60% of all adaptation is occurring in response to water related hazards.
The EU approach to water by Carmen Marques Ruiz. The EU is committed to water security for all, global resilience to water stress, protection of nature, a fair balance between water supply and demand and the right to safe drinking water and sanitation.
Water and the private sector by Antonia Lorenzo where it was highlighted that industrial water use accounts for 19%, while agriculture uses around 70% of the total extracted water. The water consumption has multiplied by 6 in the last year, twice the population growth. If there is no change in the business as usual scenario and in the consumption patterns, the global water deficit is estimated to be 40% by 2050.  Private sector, agriculture and industry  play a central role in the transition to  a more sustainable economy.
Water and youth by
Clara Tomé: Get to know people from indigenous communities who don't even have 5L of water a day, stories of girls who, by having to go fetch water, expose themselves to being raped and sexually abused every day. Water is a recognized human right that is being violated for billions of people that lack access. Indigenous communities, women and the most vulnerable people must be at the forefront of these decisions, the global south needs representation and access to conferences like this one.
Young Climate activism linked to the EU Climate Pact by Anahí Lopez: possibilities for young people in the European Union to learn about the environment and water, while practising languages, getting to know other cultures and promoting EU values. like Erasmus+ programmes, and European Solidarity Corps . Finally, the #Filluptheglass campaign on youth participation and the need to listen to our voices.
- A questionnaire was carried out with youth and presented by Anna Wendy Brodbelt  to determine the effect of climate change on mental health in youth. Two insights : 1 youth care about climate change and its adverse effects. 2, youth want to act, but they do not have access to the basic resources and information. Hence, it is necessary to take information where youth move: i.e social networks.","We identified a series of Key recommendations for action which is what we will be raising awareness on and also publishing on. (see below). The impact is intangible, but nevertheless important.
There is a need for greater cooperation between the water and climate communities.
Climate negotiators should give greater attention to the role of water in addressing the climate crisis.
On the other hand, the water community should promote the importance of water in climate adaptation and mitigation and develop concrete water-related proposals for inclusion in nationally determined contributions (NDCs)
We need political will to make progress
Improved governance is a key issue, in particular at the international level. Legal commitments and an international institution clearly responsible are needed.
There is a need to move from the current “silo approach” to a more “interconnected and integrated approach” to deal with water sustainable management.
Business as usual is no longer a viable option. Radical change is required, also in the private sector, to move to a circular economy to cope with water challenges.
Water is a critical entry point for adaptation to climate change.
Climate change adaptation has to be an integral part of water resource planning and management and vice versa, adaptation to climate change needs to consider water planning and management as an important measure for climate change adaptation.","EU Climate pact, Bioazul, Icatalist, A4voces","Goal 6, Goal 13","6.5, 6.6, 6.b , 13.1, 13.2, 13.3","Sun, 04/09/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2024 - 12:00",https://climate-pact.europa.eu/index_en ; https://www.bioazul.com/  ;  https://www.icatalist.eu/,0.375,0.3333333333333333,0.6666666666666666,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

The initiative will implement cutting-edge Atmospheric Water Generation (AWG) technology to provide clean and safe drinking water to underserved communities and disaster-stricken areas. Additionally, it will promote sustainable urban agricultural zones to ensure access to fresh and healthy food while reducing the impact of traditional farming practices on the environment.
In collaboration with School News Nationwide, the initiative will also focus on fostering partnerships with local universities and STEM programs to educate students on sustainable practices and encourage careers in water and agricultural technology. This comprehensive approach aims to empower communities with the knowledge and resources needed to achieve long-term resilience and self-sufficiency, ultimately contributing to the global Sustainable Development Goals.","This initiative will have a significant impact on accelerating the implementation of SDGs by addressing multiple interconnected goals simultaneously. By providing clean drinking water to underserved communities through the use of advanced Atmospheric Water Generation technology, the initiative contributes to achieving SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation), ensuring access to safe and sustainable water resources.
Moreover, by promoting sustainable urban agricultural zones, the initiative addresses SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), as it helps create food security in regions that struggle with access to fresh and nutritious food. This approach also supports SDG 13 (Climate Action) by mitigating the environmental impact of traditional agricultural practices and fostering resilience to climate change.
Additionally, through partnerships with School News Nationwide and local educational institutions, the initiative contributes to SDG 4 (Quality Education) by providing students with learning opportunities in STEM fields related to sustainable water and agriculture practices. This empowers the next generation with the knowledge and skills needed to develop innovative solutions for future global challenges.
Lastly, the initiative promotes SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) by collaborating with various stakeholders, including governments, private sector, educational institutions, and NGOs, to achieve a more significant impact and long-term sustainability.

Source of Innovation focuses on four components:
1-Strengthening the demand for innovative solutions - empowering service providers by providing them with tools, methodologies, and opportunities to test innovative solutions.
2- Strengthening the supply for sectoral innovation - identifying and supporting in a dynamic and interactive way the supply of innovative solutions and products developed by the private sector and the innovation ecosystem.
3- Promote the formation of alliances between emerging companies and entrepreneurs, service providers and investors, strengthening the regional innovation ecosystem and its key players, as well as creating and strengthening spaces for dialogue.
4- Foster a culture and environment conducive to innovation in the water, sanitation and solid waste sector, facilitating a cultural shift towards innovation in the sector in Latin America and the Caribbean.
This will be achieved through activities such as: the e-Hackathon for young people to develop innovative ideas to address gaps in the WASH sector (i.e. sanitation in informal settlements, water services in dispersed rural areas), the Ideas in Action awards that recognize service operating companies, and the IDB-FEMSA Awards for entrepreneurs and innovative companies, to promote cooperation for water and tangible actions for the coming years in the sector.","State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) of the Government of Switzerland, Government of Israel, Ministry of Environment of the Government of South Korea, Fundación FEMSA and Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI).",Goal 6,,,,Call for proposals for start-up (IDB FEMSA Award 2023) is open: https://challenges.tekuoia.com/calls/bid_femsa_2023,0.0,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.75,0.0,0.16483516483516544

The installation was build in the TU led and EU financed Water Mining project and will be implemented for the first time outside Europe. 
o	The biopolymer offers a green, sustainable and novel material, which will create local value chains. The polymer is anyway formed biologically during the treatment process and currently disposed. One of our partners is commercially using the polymer in agricultural applications. The polymer is a raw product for the production of other materials. It replaces oil-derived materials and higher value applications are possible, such as for the production of flame resistant materials or construction material. 
o	In addition, nutrients recovery can be integrated in the biopolymer extraction process.  The technology is ‘easy-to-implement’ and ‘scalable’ to wastewater treatment for urban and industrial uses. The demonstration unit comes with a multidisciplinary approach. This approach, established in the Water Mining project, will be replicated in Brazil.  In the multidisciplinary, multinational Water Mining project the installation was built and was tested in Portugal. In parallel social, governance, economic and educational needs were addressed. 
o	The development of local value chains will provide economic incentives to build and maintain wastewater collection and treatment systems all over the world. We see our approach as a model for other places in the global south: Recovering resources from wastewater for high value application to provide economic incentive for sanitation. 
o	The objective is to bring the biopolymer extraction plant to Brazil and establish partnerships with local authorities, academic institutions and private industry to catalyze the development of local value chains. The project serves as a showcase to promote circular wastewater and water treatment all over the globe.","o	Imagine what it means for sanitation worldwide when wastewater treatment returns more clean water, costs less energy and earns income from recovered materials. In projects such as Water Mining we jointly design sustainable resource recovery to give water and wastewater treatment an economic drive in different locations. The resources are so valuable that the wastewater treatment and desalination plants can be adapted to provide the higher water returns and energy savings. Our joint findings will stimulate circular water and wastewater treatment all over the world, and help improving local industry and agriculture. It is time to reproduce our technologies and approach with partners outside Europe. 
o	Our work is addressing the SDGs 6, 8, 9, 10, 17. Our approach is directly linked to sanitation (SDG6). The creation of sustainable / circular economies with development of labour, manufacturing sites and knowledge clusters will remain local due to the local production and treatment of wastewater. We expect site specific products to be developed locally addressing SDGs 8, 9 and 10. We look forward to exchange and share our knowledge with people from all over the world with different interests, professions and needs to improve sanitation.

In 2012, ICOMOS Netherlands started to raise the importance of water-related heritage for a sustainable future. In 2013, the international conference ""Protecting deltas: heritage helps"" was organized in Amsterdam with the support of the Cultural Heritage Agency of the Netherlands, with the results of ‘the Statement of Amsterdam’ and the publication ""Water & heritage; material, conceptual and spiritual connections”. In 2016, ICOMOS NL, TU Delft and the LDE Centre for Global Heritage and Development organised a two-day international conference ""Water and Heritage for the Future"" that led to the publication of an edited volume entitled 'Adaptive strategies for water heritage'. At this conference the idea for an International Scientific Committee 'Water and Heritage' was born. In 2017, at the General Assembly of ICOMOS, the ICOMOS Scientific Council officially requested ICOMOS NL to make a proposal for an International Scientific Committee on Water and Heritage. There is now a Program Committee with representatives from five continents and from both WATER (IWA, ICID, CIRAT) and various scientific committees of ICOMOS, an Advisory Board and a Concept Note. Furthermore a UNESCO Chair Water, Ports and Historic Cities has been established in the Leiden-Delft-Erasmus PortCityFutures Centre. 
Two new partners (Amstel Gooi en Vecht, and Witteveen&Bos) joined the core team in 2021 around the ‘Valuing Water’ initiative to promote the significance of culture and heritage values. In the run-up of the UN Conference on the Midterm Comprehensive Review of the Implementation of the Objectives of the International Decade for Action ""Water for Sustainable Development"" the group developed various activities (conference, ceremony), reports (open access, peer-reviewed Blue Papers journal; Dutch Compendium), to understand the historical landscape of water systems with water connecting past, present and future. 
The project group organised an official UN side event called ""Water and Heritage: Connecting Past, Present and Future"" which brought together a diverse and interdisciplinary group to discuss concepts, methodologies and case studies. It fosters alliances between water, culture and heritage sectors, offering synergies and new opportunities vital to addressing water-related challenges. The collective insight from the organizers and the participants into functional, spatial, temporal, material and immaterial dimensions of water contributed to improved integrated perspectives on water, culture and heritage for the future. Discussions have resulted in alternative concepts, improved methodologies and international case studies deepening the understanding of historical contexts, governance and culture. A new open access platform has been established to host the diverse output of the group and to facilitate the emergence of a DEDICATED INTERNATIONAL NETWORK.
The establishment of such a network legitimizes a decade of advocating to connect water, culture and heritage and stubborn optimism and points towards successful future contributions to the water-related targets outlined in the 2030 Agenda, and a sustainable future of our most valuable resource, water.","WE AIM AT ENHANCING COHESIVE, PEACEFUL AND RESPECTFUL DIALOGUES CONNECTING WATER, CULTURE AND HERITAGE, AGREED BY ALL CONCERNED AND OPEN TO ALL ACTORS THAT SHARE ITS OBJECTIVES.
The United Nations acknowledges the importance of coherently implementing water-related goals and achieving targets outlined in the 2030 Agenda. The Dushanbe Declaration (2022) emphasizes the need to accelerate efforts and strengthen political and technical dialogue on water at the highest level. The International Symposium on Water and Cultural Heritage in Tokyo in 2020, is one point of departure for our commitments. They built upon the Chair's statement highlighting the importance of multi-disciplinary dialogues to develop narratives on the significance of harnessing water-related heritage. Through such collaboration we enhance our movement towards achieving the water-related targets outlined in the 2030 Agenda.

•	Support the UN Member States with evidence-based policy- and decision-making for SDG 6 under limited data circumstances.
•	Encourage the participating countries to strengthen the enabling environment around national water management.
•	Enable cross-sectorial collaboration between experts and decision-makers to successfully achieve SDG 6.
Implementation methodologies
•	“SDG 6 Policy Support System (SDG-PSS)” – the key output of the project – was designed and developed to help government officials and stakeholders navigate limited data conditions and promote evidence-based policy to contribute to achieving SDG 6.
SDG-PSS’s main features
•	Components: Capacity; Finance; Policy and Institutional; Gender Mainstreaming; Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)/Resilience Mainstreaming; Integrity; and Status.
•	Mechanism: As water experts enter required data for each component into a set of questionnaires, the Summary View reports the collective outcome. Thus, the Summary View consists of all the evidence generated for each SDG 6 target and indicator and for each policy critical component of the tool from the entered data.
Under the SDG-PSS project, the consortium partners commit to jointly accelerate the SDG 6 implementation by:
•	Providing logical background for evidence-based policymaking with the aim of significantly increasing the implementation rate of SDG 6 of the participating countries.
•	Hosting regional/global workshops to extend the use of the tool in up to 50 countries and disseminate the success story of participating countries.
•	Contributing to the capacity development activities through the development of the e-course on SDG-PSS in more diverse languages.
•	Participating in international conferences as the side-event organizer to promote the tool to more potential countries.
With these joint efforts, each of the project partners will keep pushing forward their mandate to accelerate the water actions and set their own ambitious goals for the achievement of SDG 6 as below:
•	UNOSD, UNU-INWEH, and UNESCO i-WSSM will expand and reinforce the partnership with the participating countries to support accelerating the implementation of water-related SDGs at the national level through policy advisory services, knowledge sharing, and capacity development programs.
•	The regional hub countries (Brazil, Pakistan, Republic of Korea, Tunisia) will (1) share experiences, challenges, and possibilities in achieving SDG 6 at the national level; (2) promote SDG-PSS through discussions on how the tool can be used to produce evidence on water-related policymaking at the national level; and (3) discussing the ways for the extended use of SDG-PSS in more other regions.
•	Tunisia and Brazil will disseminate the tool and the user experience at the national level, especially among the ministries and entities developing the Voluntary National Reviews (VNR), and at the international level through establishing projects and partnerships;
•	In Tunisia, the project team will keep the national working group active, promote the SDG-PSS to develop the VNR, and hold information-sharing days with key stakeholders.
•	In Brazil, the project team will launch a report in 3 different languages about the outcomes of using SDG-PSS which leads to an action plan. The experience in using SDG-PSS will be shared with the Community of Portuguese-Speaking Countries (CPLP).","The Initiative will have impacts on accelerating the implementation of SDG 6 by:
•	Addressing challenges in collecting water-related information and trends systematically under limited data circumstances.
•	Providing countries with a systematic approach to produce evidence on the enabling environments of SDG 6.
•	Supporting evidence-based policy- and decision-making for SDG 6 at the national and sub-national levels through its use.
•	Offering a platform for multi-sectoral experts to exchange knowledge, promote evidence-based policy, and collaborate more closely to generate water evidence.
•	Strengthening international cooperation through follow-up with the project countries, organizing regional workshops in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean regions.
•	Building capacity among water professionals on using SDG-PSS by offering an e-course on the tool in English, Spanish, French, and Arabic languages.","United Nations Office for Sustainable Development (UNOSD), UNU Institute for Water, Environment and Health (UNU-INWEH), UNESCO International Centre for Water Security and Sustainable Management (UNESCO i-WSSM), Korea Water Resources Corporation (K-water), Ministry of Environment of the Republic of Korea (MoE), Korea Environment Corporation (K-eco)",Goal 6,"6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b","Thu, 09/01/2016 - 12:00","Thu, 12/31/2026 - 12:00",https://inweh.unu.edu/projects/accelerating-the-implementation-of-water…,1.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.3296703296703309

In addition, WE-ACT aims for inclusive, forward-looking and climate risk-informed water allocation planning and management processes, ultimately guiding decision-makers in transboundary rivers to share transboundary waters equitably among different sectors and users. These will reap the benefits of appropriate water allocation regimes via improved water policies, valuation of water, and stakeholder engagement. Concretely, the project will be carried out in two catchments of a transboundary river basin in Central Asia, namely the Naryn and Kara Darya catchments of the Syr Darya river basin, covering parts of Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. Based on a reliable data supply chain that captures a thorough understanding of water availability, demand, footprint and allocation in a glacier-fed river basin on the back-end, water resources managers will operate an accessible and intuitive DSS on the front-end to understand, manage and communicate management options. Data supply chain and DSS will be matched with an in-depth understanding of water policies, financing instruments, incentives and stakeholder priorities that face increasing pressures of climate change, growing demand and economic water dependency notably in the energy (hydropower) and agriculture (water-intensive crops) sectors. WE-ACT aims to: enhance the accessibility, usability and exchange of hydro-meteorological data between stakeholders in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan; enhance the understanding of the status quo of water availability, water demand, water use, and water allocation; improve the understanding of the economic and societal value of water and developments in key economic sectors to inform water allocation strategies; inform forward-looking transboundary water allocation strategies under climate change and socio-economic developments; enable water managers and decision-makers to efficiently allocate water in a transboundary setting using digital technologies; improve water policies and institutional capacity addressing economic and legal aspects of cross border cooperation and the impact pathways of the DSS towards efficient climate-sensitive water allocation. WE-ACT goes beyond the state of the art of digital instruments for water allocation, as the DSS will rely on innovative procedures, processes, and technologies. The project proposes a comprehensive project methodology consisting of three components: Component 1 lays the foundation of data and information needed to understand water allocation challenges. It consists of 3 building blocks, In-situ measurement & soft sensor: improving data availability; Integrated model system: water availability, demand & allocation; and Future scenarios: climate risk informed water management. Component 2 provides the building blocks to move from information to impact, through stakeholder engagement, cross-border policies for sustainable benefit-sharing, and finance mechanisms for efficient water allocation and use. Component 3 contains the building blocks for the technical realization of the Data warehouse & model engine, as a one-stop-shop for data needed to build the Digital skeleton of the DSS.","The WE-ACT project is expected to accelerate the implementation of several Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) related to water and climate change, including SDG 6 (clean water and sanitation), SDG 13 (climate action), and SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals).
Firstly, the project will contribute to achieving SDG 6 by promoting more efficient and equitable allocation of water resources in a transboundary river, which will improve water availability and sanitation for the populations in the catchment areas. The project will also help to increase the resilience of the water sector to climate change, which is critical for achieving SDG 6. Furthermore, the project's focus on stakeholder engagement and inclusive water allocation planning will contribute to SDG 6's targets on participatory water governance. WE-ACT predominantly addresses indicator 6.4., and indicator 6.5, additionally it contributes to 6.a and 6.b.
Secondly, WE-ACT contributes to SDG 12 which aims to achieve sustainable consumption and production and management and efficient use of natural resources. This is because the project focuses on improving water resource management in the pilot areas, which includes promoting sustainable practices for water use and ensuring the efficient use of water resources. By improving the management of water resources, the project can also contribute to achieving other targets under SDG 12 such as reducing waste generation, improving resource efficiency, and promoting sustainable consumption and production.
Thirdly, the project will contribute to achieving SDG 13 by promoting climate-sensitive water allocation systems and financing mechanisms, which will increase the resilience of water resources management and planning to climate change. By providing decision-makers with better information and digital tools, the project will enable them to make more informed decisions about water allocation in the face of climate change. The project will also help to reduce water-related greenhouse gas emissions, particularly in the energy and agriculture sectors, which will contribute to SDG 13's targets on mitigation.
Finally, the project will contribute to achieving SDG 17 by promoting partnerships for the goals between stakeholders in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan. The project's focus on enhancing the accessibility, usability, and exchange of hydro-meteorological data between stakeholders will improve cross-border cooperation and benefit-sharing, which is critical for achieving SDG 17's targets on international cooperation and partnerships. The project will also promote partnerships between stakeholders in different sectors, including water, energy, and agriculture, to ensure that water allocation decisions are informed by the needs and priorities of all users.
The project also has the potential to contribute to other SDGs such as SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy) by reducing the water footprint of water-using sectors, promoting sustainable use and protection of water resources, and fostering adoption of digital technologies in water management. Overall, the project has the potential to contribute to interlinkages between various SDGs and accelerate their implementation. By improving water availability, resilience to climate change, and promoting cross-border cooperation and partnerships, the project will help to accelerate progress towards the SDGs and their interlinkages.",Technische Universitaet Muenchen; Bayerische Forschungsallianz Bavarian Research Alliance GmbH; Portolan Association; Nelen & Schuurmans Technology B.V.; International Water Management Institute; Universiteit Twente; FutureWater SL;  HAEDES BV; Brunel University London; Inosens Doo Novi Sad; Julius-Maximilians-Universitaet Wuerzburg; Université De Fribourg; Central-Asian Institute for Applied Geosciences;,"Goal 6, Goal 13, Goal 17","6.4, 6.5, 6.a, 6.b , 13.2, 13.3, 17.6, 17.7, 17.8, 17.17","Sun, 01/01/2023 - 12:00","Thu, 12/31/2026 - 12:00","For additional information such as relevant photos, short video clips, or key documents related to our initiative, we invite you to visit our official website at weact-project.eu.

All parties in the coalition take their own responsibility and will voluntarily commit to:
1.	Being an ambassador for NBS;
2.	Promoting the inclusion of NBS as an option in the realisation of solutions for societal challenges in the water sector;
3.	Presenting examples of how NBS solutions act as an alternative to traditional infrastructure;
4.	Joining, supporting or creating fundamental and applied research projects to further develop NBS as a standard option; and
5.	Promoting, supporting or co-investing in enablers for the development of NBS, such as a sound business case, technical, ecological, social and system knowledge.
The coalition will offer an inclusive, action-oriented, cross sectoral, platform of exchange. For participants, it will offer them the opportunity to exchange knowledge and experience, to profile their work and actions for NBS in an international setting and to connect with the frontrunners in the water sector. The parties in the coalition join forces in a productive coalition working towards mainstreaming NBS.
Action and follow-up
The coalition proponents will develop the details of this commitment further during and after the UN2023 Water Conference. The coalition is intended to be formalized at the conference and open to new members in the near future.
Coalition members will translate the commitments mentioned above into actions that they will undertake and both interact and report upon in the coalition. By collaboration and strengthened cooperation within the coalition it will be possible to translate commitment to action and action to impact.","The UN 2023 Water Conference will take place at UN Headquarters in New York, 22-24 March 2023. The organizers (Tajikistan and the Netherlands) aim to present water action-oriented coalitions there. As one of such coalitions, the organizers and participating organizations intend to launch the Nature-based Solutions (NBS) coalition (hereinafter referred as the “coalition”) by issuing the statement (this document) to tackle water challenges at the conference. The ambition is that the progress of these plans against the targets will be monitored in follow-up conferences. In this way, the UN conference and follow-up conferences can be used as action forcing events.
Water connects all Sustainable Development Goals. Water is linked to the three pillars of sustainable development, integrating social, cultural, economic and political values. Water links the SDGs across climate, energy, cities, the environment, food security, poverty, gender equality, health and more. Climate change is changing the way we live and integrate with nature. Traditional water-related infrastructure generally is optimized against a single aspect, often producing negative side effects on other societal aspects. Moving forward, in order to tackle the societal issues of the present and the future we must integrate NBS into mainstream practices. NBS address societal challenges through the protection, sustainable management and restoration of both natural and modified ecosystems, benefiting both biodiversity and human well-being. In this way NBS deliver value across the SDG’s.
Several organizations (Asian Development Bank, Netherlands Enterprise Agency, Invest International, World Wildlife Fund, Wetlands International, The Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management/ Rijkswaterstaat and EcoShape) have joined forces to form the coalition to take action, aiming to create a breakthrough in the application and implementation of NBS for water related challenges and to make NBS a widely accepted practice by 2030.","Ecoshape

Ambassador/ Mostafa Sherbiny, an international expert on sustainability and climate, is the founder and chair of this global initiative

This initiative is considered to present a voluntary event as part of the results of the recommendations of the activities of participation in the United Nations Water Conference in March 2023 at the United Nations headquarters in New York, in which the Volunteer Team Foundation Humanitarian Action participated in, by default, ID No. G177 in 24, March 2023

It was chosen and publish it because it works to accelerate the achievement of the sixth goal of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals 7

It launched a diploma for calculating the carbon footprint for a period of 40 training hours aimed at graduating 10,000 water ambassadors to raise awareness and inspire the community to rationalize water consumption and form work teams to calculate the water footprint for companies, products and individuals

This was headed by Ambassador Mostafa Sherbiny, the international expert in sustainability, and under the supervision of the National Institute for Quality, headed by Professor Mohamed Etman. Participating in the organization of the training, This is under the auspices of Dr. Magdy Allam, President of the Specific Climate Union

 

Description Thinning program will look, largely depends on the focus of interest. Water ambassador and pioneers can be interested in the water footprint of one specific process step in a whole production chain, or in the water footprint of a final product. Alternatively.

Water ambassador and pioneers can be interested in the water footprint of a consumer or group of consumers or in the water footprint of a producer or whole economic sector.

Finally, Water ambassador can take a geographic perspective, looking at the total water footprint within a delineated area such as a municipality, province, nation, catchment or river basin. Such a total water footprint is the aggregation of the water footprints of many separate processes taking place in the area.

Training program methodology for calculating the water footprint There's no mathematical formula that can be applied to all cases to determine the water footprint of an individual consumer, good, service, or specific geographical area.

Depending on the calculation to be performed and the activity sector at stake, there are two methodologies that can be applied: Hands holding a drop of water On the one hand

On the other hand, the ISO 14046 standard's methodology is an environmental tool for assessing the impact a product, packaging, or process has throughout its entire life cycle. It's divided into four phases:

Goal and scope definition Inventory analysis of the water footprint Impact assessment of the water footprint Interpretation of results Initiative goals :

Organizing a training diploma for the water footprint on a regular basis.

Participate in United Nations events and international events and transfer experiences to water ambassadors.

Organizing international events, conferences and forums on water conservation and innovation development

Formation of a team of volunteers in the name of Ya'alon Water Ambassadors to raise awareness and inspire the community of the need for fair use of water 

Awareness programs:

Reduce showering time, turn the water off while we're applying soap and use ecological shower heads.

Aim to eat sustainable food and cut consumption of those foods that require more water, like meat.

Support sustainable and local agriculture, cattle-production and fishing. Opt for responsible consumption and the circular economy.

Elsewhere, as regards business activity the following are recommended: Implement an environmental quality system.

Encourage recycling, reuse and ecological consumption at the heart of the company. Use suppliers who are committed to reducing the water footprint .","The initiative aims to achieve water security by rationalizing water consumption and enhancing the efficiency of its use by calculating the water footprint of all products and companies through water ambassadors to preserve water resources, which calls for the need to reduce consumption and bring it closer to global levels. In response to the challenges facing groundwater in the country, the initiative will take with the authorities concerned with groundwater management a set of procedures and measures aimed at ensuring a more efficient use of groundwater through the mechanisms of integrated water resources management. It also works to rationalize the export of groundwater directly, by banning the export of bottled water from the source of groundwater, and indirectly, by banning the export of green and dry fodder produced in the country. Developing a set of procedures and measures to raise awareness in order to rationalize water consumption, such as improving agricultural policies, and maximizing the use of treated wastewater. Civil society oversight of tools that rationalize water consumption, replace tools that rationalize water consumption, and intensify awareness campaigns directed at various sectors and members of society, in addition to adopting strategies and options that will contribute, directly and indirectly, to rationalizing water consumption, such as the economy approach through the national strategy for green development.","The Specific Union for Climate in Egypt International

Fully mindful of its role and as an advocate of best practices, the business sector seeks to expand actions that adopt productive processes, given that these are important drivers to effect relevant improvements in the country’s macro water landscape. There are a number of shared solutions to confront the crisis and reduce consumption of large volumes of drinking water currently being carried out. These initiatives apply techniques such as reuse, managing loss, sustainable treatments for reusing industrial and domestic effluents, accumulation reservoirs, desalination solutions, use of renewable energy sources, recovery and preservation of springs and watersheds aimed at the increase of natural infrastructures, reforestation actions, and others - all of them as a response to the impact that this crisis has had on companies, biodiversity, the economy and, above all, the society.
We are working towards making our Commitment a national benchmark for the effective contribution of companies to water security in Brazil, providing transparency and visibility to data and information on initiatives, projects and goals that have been adopted, thereby permitting greater engagement and promotion of experiences, learning and information.
Each signatory company backs the initiative and pledges to contribute to at least 2 of the 6 goals in this Commitment by 2030:
1. INCREASE THE INCLUSION OF THE WATER ISSUE IN BUSINESS STRATEGIES
2. MITIGATE THE RISKS OF WATER FOR THE BUSINESS
3. MEASURE WATER MANAGEMENT AT THE COMPANY AND ANNOUNCE IT PUBLICLY
4. ENCOURAGE SHARED PROJECTS DEALING WITH WATER
5. PROMOTE THE ENGAGEMENT OF THE CHAIN
6. CONTRIBUTE WITH TECHNOLOGIES, KNOWLEDGE, PROCESSES AND HUMAN RESOURCES","The signatory companies pledge to make the actions and projects referring to the goals chosen in the Platform / HUB of the Brazilian Business Commitment for Water Security publicly available in a transparent, clear and open way, so that the greatest number of Brazilian companies committed to water security in Brazil can become engaged, offering a lively, dynamic environment shared by companies and the society.
By declaring our commitments to sustainable water management and the country’s water security, we believe that we will be making a positive contribution with solutions that tackle the water crisis.

It can also contribute to accelerating the achievement of SDGs by addressing interlinkages between various goals and targets. For instance, it can advance SDG 17 by promoting sustainable development partnerships and SDG 11 by advocating for innovation and inclusivity in urban planning. Furthermore, by empowering and involving young people, the initiative can support SDG 4's goal of ensuring inclusive and equitable access to quality education and lifelong learning opportunities.","It's challenging to provide a comprehensive list of potential partners and beneficiaries for an initiative related to water economy without more specific information. However, there are some possible examples of partners and beneficiaries. Public sector organizations such as the Ministry of Water Resources, local water authorities, or municipal governments could be partners or beneficiaries. Private sector organizations involved in water-related industries, like water treatment, distribution, or conservation, could also be partners or beneficiaries. Civic society organizations, including NGOs focused on water-related issues, could provide expertise, advocacy, and community engagement to support the initiative's goals. Local communities, particularly those that rely on water resources for their livelihoods or basic needs, could also benefit from the initiative.

The TEI provides a framework for coordinated action between EU Member States and EU institutions with the African Union Commission (AUC) and its Member States, the African Ministers' Council on Water (AMCOW), the African Network of Basin Organisations (ANBO), and African Regional Economic Communities (RECs).
Standing as a flagship initiative on transboundary water management in Africa, the TEI falls within the scope of the Global Gateway Investment Package. By serving global objectives of the European Green Deal, TEI investments will support large-scale projects in Africa to deliver tangible benefits at continental, regional/basin, and national levels.
More specifically, at continental level, the TEI will engage with the AUC, AMCOW, and ANBO, to strengthen the institutional framework governing the African water security agenda. Actions will include technical assistance to upgrade continental administrative and technical functions.
At regional and basin level, the TEI will support RECs based on their mandates and engagement on water management. Support will scale-up the role of transboundary water cooperation to enable economic development and regional integration, and facilitate institutional arrangements.
At country level, actions will complement regional and basin actions by setting in motion water management policies and legislative tools to enable cooperation processes and dialogues among riparian states. Support will promote coordinated development and management of water and related resources to maximize benefits among parties.","The TEI promotes increased water security, supports (regional) stability and enhances the resilience and peaceful development of the continent trough transboundary water management and cooperation (as per SDG 6.5.2). To this end, the TEI will support the whole Agenda 2030 and in particular SDG 2 (hunger), SDG 5 (gender equality), SDG 8 (economic growth), SDG 13 (climate change), SDG 15 (life on land), SDG 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions) and SDG 17 (partnerships for the goals).
As such, the TEI supports achieving the vision of the EU-Africa partnerships, in compliance with the Africa Water Vision 2025 and the African Union’s Agenda 2063 (""The Africa We Want""). In addition, it is also well in line with the Green Deal and the Commitments of the Paris Agreement.","Various EU Member States, including France, Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, Czech Republic, Slovenia as well as EU institutions (i.a.

Besides, resources such as water are not wasted as transport medium. Our feces can later be used as fertilizer or as an energy source. Our toilets can be partially produced on a local level and the rest will be delivered from Germany. Each of the units can work independently and can be installed on stable ground. We want more people to be able to use sanitation and have a safe removal of the feces. 2.

By contributing to the achievement of the goals set forth by the SDGs, these commitments are essential in realizing the vision of a more sustainable future.
Promoting and expanding education programs and projects for rational water use is a key aspect of achieving SDG 6, which aims to ensure access to clean water and sanitation for all. By increasing awareness and understanding of the importance of water conservation, these programs can help to reduce water waste and ensure that water resources are used efficiently.
Similarly, promoting technological innovation in the sanitation sector can contribute to the achievement of SDG 6 by improving access to safe and affordable sanitation services. New technologies and processes can help to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of sanitation systems, making them more accessible and affordable for all.
Encouraging the creation and strengthening of new technologies for access to water in rural communities is also critical in achieving SDG 6. In many rural areas, access to clean water is limited or non-existent, making it difficult for people to meet their basic needs. By promoting the development of new technologies that can help to address this issue, we can help to ensure that everyone has access to clean water.
Furthermore, promoting and incentivizing the creation and strengthening of new technologies and alternatives for wastewater treatment can help to contribute to the universalization of basic sanitation, which is also a key component of SDG 6. Wastewater treatment is essential in protecting public health and the environment, and new technologies can help to make this process more efficient and effective.
Intensifying advocacy actions in recognizing the rights of rivers and promoting life in harmony with nature can also help to achieve multiple SDGs. By protecting our natural resources and promoting sustainable development practices, we can help to achieve a range of goals related to environmental sustainability, poverty reduction, and social development.
Finally, promoting and strengthening education programs and projects for peace and debates promoting peace, especially in disputes over access to water, can help to achieve SDG 16, which aims to promote peaceful and inclusive societies. Access to water is often a source of conflict and tension, and by promoting peaceful resolutions to disputes over water resources, we can help to promote greater social cohesion and stability.
In conclusion, the commitments outlined above represent critical steps towards achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. By promoting greater access to clean water and sanitation, protecting our natural resources, and promoting social development and peace, we can help to create a more sustainable and equitable world for all.","Association of Sabesp Engineers

Possible mental health and psychosocial outcomes are extensive (WHO, 2022). The existing mechanisms to support the impacts of water-related climate risks on mental health by government and non-government agencies are often disaggregated, and in many countries, specific action plans and initiatives to support affected households and communities are limited or absent (WHO, 2014). There is a visible gap in the coordination of effective practices to provide affected people with the required mental health and psychosocial services (MHPSS). As communities continue to cope with and respond to water-related climate risks and environmental degradation, we argue that water governance frameworks must be amplified to include these dimensions and support practitioners to build psychological resilience within communities and ourselves. Building on existing research from the United Nations University - Climate Resilience Initiative project (https://cri.merit.unu.edu/), our water action agenda will support a collective ‘call for action’ towards the aggregated knowledge and better understanding of robust evidence and ‘fit to propose’ solutions to address mental health implications of water insecurities and disaster events, and overall, boosting the water for climate resilience agenda. Implementation methodologies: Our agenda is threefold. Research (understanding , developing indicators), Capacity development (awareness building, climate literacy, training for service providers, educational materials, workshops / webinars, publications for practitioners), Policy (customised recommendation, multi-stakeholder consultations). The engagements will be based on the following activities: Enhancing the understanding of the interlinkages of climate change and climate change related disasters and mental health / psychological well-being, a) how they influence populations’ decision-makings such as family planning, mobility, consumption choices, pro-environmental behaviour, climate activities; b) vulnerability factors and inequalities (e.g., gender, age, intergenerational inequity, socioeconomic status) Multi-country comparative research on current status of a) existing support services that can acknowledge psychological and psychiatric needs, b) identifying multisectoral and community based approaches that enables reducing vulnerabilities and mental health impacts of climate risks Increasing climate literacy and awareness building: a) interlinkages of climate literacy and awareness and engagement to pro-environmental behavior, b) developing the tools or platforms for capacity development (climate communication, role of media, NGOs), b) how can we utilize the capacity to reduce the impacts of climate change on mental health? Identify unique advantages of youth and future generations that contribute to the vision of an inclusive climate resilient future: a) how can we empower the future generation to climate action, b) role of schools and climate education Collate the data and tools from the above, and develop policy recommendations and multi-stakeholder consultations towards integrated climate services to enable building mental health resilience for all Follow-up mechanisms: By developing tools and materials for capacity development based on the aggregated insights from the research, we will ensure that the actors who are involved will be informed, and will be able to gain follow-up sessions, access to published materials, and attend to multi-stakeholder consultations.","We aim to enhance understanding of the following elements by assessing gaps and needs in the existing support mechanisms through capturing reflections from different geographic regions across the world, voices from practices and youth and their capacities to integrate support services in water strategies to contribute in addressing SDG 3, 5, 6, and 13 in particular: Interlinkages of water insecurity and water related disasters, climate change and mental health and psychosocial well-being, with a focus on vulnerability factors and inequalities (e.g., gender, age, indigenous status, disability, socioeconomic status), and how support services can acknowledge psychosocial and psychiatric needs Environmental degradation in landscapes / waterscapes and biodiversity, and its impact on mental health; Emerging concepts of mental health outcomes such as climate change anxiety, eco-grief, solastalgia and how they relate to water insecurities Empowering and accelerating unique advantages of the youth and future generations could contribute to the vision of an inclusive climate resilient future Developing multisectoral and community based approaches to reduce vulnerabilities and mental health impacts of water insecurity and water related disasters; how we can build and implement smart water strategies in climate services to enable building mental health resilience for all","UN system: UNU-MERIT UNU-CRIS UNU-EHS UNU-IAS UNU-INWEH WHO - Climate Change and Health Unit UNICEF - Climate Change Consultant for Climate, Environment, Energy, and DRR UNESCO (tbc: Water and Gender Working Group ) UN-MGCY - DRR Member states: United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Directorate for Energy and Climate Change, The Scottish Government Ministry of Sustainability, Innovation and the Environment, Government of Anguilla Ministry of Health, Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe Academic institution Glasgow Caledonian University, UK University of Florence, Italy (tbc) Imo State University, Owerri, Nigeria Private sector: Bulgarian Association for Personalized Medicine (tbc) Cigna Healthcare (tbc) Civil society, NGOs: Associazione Italiana Ansia da Cambiamento Climatico Italian Institute for Planetary Health ICATALIST, Spain Green Hope Foundation, Canada (tbc)","Goal 3, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 11, Goal 13","3.5, 3.c, 3.d, 5.1 , 5.2, 5.c , 6.1 , 6.2, 6.b , 11.5, 11.b, 13.1, 13.3, 13.b","Mon, 03/20/2023 - 12:00","Sun, 12/31/2028 - 12:00","UN Water Conference Virtual side event website

The ethical support of this project is the express recognition of the right of all human beings to access drinking water, as well as the consideration of water as a common good, which under no circumstances should be confused with that of a commodity. The OCAs are groups whose members act in a voluntary, supportive, disinterested and committed manner, in surveillance and permanent monitoring of water sources.

El sustento ético de este proyecto es el reconocimiento expreso del derecho de todos los seres humanos a acceder al agua potable, así como la consideración del agua como un bien común, que en ningún caso debe confundirse con la de una mercancía. Los OCAs son agrupaciones cuyos integrantes actúan de manera voluntaria, solidaria, desinteresada y comprometida, en la vigilancia y monitoreo permanente de las fuentes de agua.","Accompany communities in the process of applying for the Blue Flag award in the Micro-watersheds category, in order to promote their responsible participation in the conservation, restoration and protection of these important geographical units.
	Apply bioremediation techniques through the use of effective microorganisms to combat contamination problems in water bodies.
	Work with formal education institutions in order to instill in children, and through them families and communities, an interest in the bodies of water close to their homes and schools, so that they develop a sense of of belonging and mutual care with rivers, streams, lakes and lagoons.
	The cartographic analysis is a fundamental tool for the good performance of the OCAs. It is by means of this important technique, among others, that the state of the river and its adjacent areas, the uses of the land, the geomorphology of the river, and all the basic elements for a reliable analysis of the river can be known.
	Promote the recovery and conservation of the quality of our bodies of water so that they can maintain the fundamental role they play in the development of the country and in the quality of life of the inhabitants. Initiative that seeks to integrate groups of citizens and businessmen, as well as local and national authorities and institutions into the fight in favor of rivers and our bodies of water in general.
	Promote Surveillance, safeguarding and protection of our bodies of water.
	Carbon Footprint: benefit granted to organizations that support OCA's, carrying out the inventory of greenhouse gases and their compensation, to obtain carbon neutrality certification.
	Expansion of the network. Each observatory should try to convince other neighboring communities about the need to establish their own OCA. Task not always easy but necessary for the regional growth of the OCA's. Fortunately, there are already the first seven OCA's as a result of this delicate extension task that the OCA's assume once they are established.
	Promote activities that bring communities closer to their rivers, so that there is a happy reunion of the inhabitants with their rivers and that current generations revive the relationship that their ancestors maintained with the different bodies of water (so that grandchildren can bathe in the community river and enjoy it like your grandparents did).
	Recovery of Forest Cover, which seeks to promote the conservation of gallery forests, highlighting the role of cover in the protection of water resources, the establishment of native forest vegetation and respect for its protection zone as established by law.

Pratt Institute, Pace University and Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD) set a goal in 2022 of partnering with cross-sectoral stakeholders in New York City and Singapore, two of the most densely populated urban archipelagos in the world. Bringing together Engineering, Design, Science, Law and Business the three institutions have established the Center for Climate Adaptation. While they are surrounded by water, urban archipelagos ironically share issues of water scarcity, limited resource/water independence from mainland counterparts and issues of water access and/or safety. They are the canary in the coal mine of the coming decades of permanent climate change; they are hit first and hardest. They must swiftly move beyond mitigation. They need to adapt, borrow lessons learned from one another and develop scalable, rapid, nature-based solutions for living with and harvesting multiple types of water. As a network of centers, we pledge to work across institutions, between architecture, engineering, science, law and business, with local community partners and with industry partners to develop realizable, nature-based solutions in the coming five years. We will add one to two urban archipelagos a year to expand our research beyond Singapore and New York City. This will include (by 2024) the Chiloe and Patagonian Archipelagos in Chile and the Daman/Diu Islands in the Western coast of India, launching partnerships with Universidad del Desarrollo (UDD) and Anant National University (ANU) respectively. Archipelagos provide unique insight into the climate challenges threatening the entire planet, its social politics and economics which can be boiled down into one simple binary fable: it is only because we think of the planet as water versus continents that we defend one against the other. Archipelagos have been inundated for centuries. There are indigenous cultures, rituals and practices that live with, on and under water in archipelagos in unique and meaningful ways. Each offer insight as to how we might develop sustainably in the most vulnerable regions of the planet.","The Archipelago Agenda seeks ultimately to move fast, yet study close. We seek to build partnerships within these complex geomorphic and geopolitical regions.

            Continue to promote and implement the valuing water principles, through:  1.	VWI 2.0 journeys: the journeys seek to mobilize key actors and decision makers to apply the valuing water principles and values perspective in policy, business practices behavior","Organizations, communities and sectors who stand to benefit from improved management and governance of water resources",Netherlands,Global,"The Government of the Netherlands commits to start a new phase of the Valuing Water Initiative. The new phase of the programme will run from 2024 until 2027, and will be known as the Valuing Water Initiative 2.0 (VWI 2.0). Overall, VWI 2.0 will be a continuation and expansion of the VWI 2019-2023 program. Starting in 2024, the program will run for three years.
Since its official launch, the Valuing Water Initiative (VWI) actively implements the five Valuing Water Principles (VWP) on a global scale. These principles, developed by the United Nations and World Bank High-Level Panel on Water, are as follows:
1.	Recognize and embrace water’s multiple values to different groups and
2.	Reconcile values and build trust
3.	Protect the water sources;
4.	Educate to empower;
5.	Invest and innovate.
While achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) remains a top priority, VWI 2.0 will also seek to build upon the successes of its predecessor program and will focus on better decision-making impacting water. VWI 2.0 is comprised of five key components:  
1.	VWI 2.0 journeys: the journeys seek to mobilize key actors and decision makers to apply the valuing water principles and values perspective in policy, business practices and behavior across contexts, sectors, organizations and companies.
2.	Leadership by example: this workstream that seeks to inspire and engage actors who commit to learning how to apply the UN valuing water principles and share learnings
3.	Learning platform: we aim to develop a knowledge platform to support best practices to value water and share knowledge of valuing water approaches
4.	Action through inspiration: we seek to mobilize effective communication to inspire others to act through inspiration, influence and collaboration.
5.	Monitoring, evaluation and learning: VWI 2.0 will work the method of outcome harvesting as the monitoring, evaluation and learning framework, which is suitable for identifying qualitative impact.
VWI 2.0 will introduce several changes compared to VWI 2019-2023, including a greater focus on the inclusion of multiple values in decision making impacting water including those of women and indigenous/local communities.","In March 2018 the High Level Panel for Water (HLPW) presented its final report ‘Making Every Drop Count’, recommending that we all need to understand, value and manage water better. The HLPW elaborated this generic recommendation in 14 specific areas. One of their main recommendations was the implementation of the Valuing Water Principles, which will be the main purpose of the Valuing Water Initiative 2.0. Acting on these recommendations may help achieve the water-related SDGs – specifically SDG 6, but including many other SDGs which depend on the availability and good governance of water resources.","The Valuing Water Initiative will continue to work with a wide range of partners across different geographies, sectors and stakeholder groups","Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 8, Goal 9, Goal 10, Goal 11, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 15, Goal 16, Goal 17","6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b",,,www.valuingwaterinitiative.org,1.0,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05494505494505515

Particularly reform-minded utilities in low- and middle-income countries will be thereby guided towards additional and diversified sources of public and, in the longer term, private sources of financing instruments, including access to local capital markets.
To this end, the global UWCI provides just-in-time, tailor-made, and closely coordinated financial and technical assistance (i.a. via transfer of peer-to-peer operator know-how).","The highly transformative Urban Water Catalyst Initiative supports the sustainable transformation of reform-minded public urban water and sanitation utilities into climate resilient, well-performing and credit-worthy public companies.
As a result of the utilities improved performance, and through partnerships developed during the process, the initiative will unlock finance for water security and urban resilience by mobilizing additional large-scale public and private finance, thus scaling-up investment and bridging the SDG 6 financing gap.
Overall, the UWCI changes the game for financing a water-secure and climate-resilient future by making a substantial contribution to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 Agenda including SDG 6, SDG 3 (health), SDG 11 (sustainable cities), SDG 13 (climate resilience) and SDG 17 (partnerships) as well as other global agendas such as the Paris Agreement, NDCs, Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the New Urban Agenda.",Netherlands - Ministry of Foreign Affairs; EU,"Goal 3, Goal 6, Goal 11, Goal 13, Goal 17","6.1 , 6.2","Thu, 03/23/2023 - 12:00",,,0.25,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1098901098901103

If we are consistent in adopting a much-needed global transformation for a circular and resilient economy, wastewater management must feature more strongly in development policy. The situation is critical in a range of member states and is further exacerbated by the climate crisis. Wastewater is wasted since it cannot be adequately treated for safe reuse. This committment will take a fresh look at SDG6.3.1. promoting a new initiative to better integrate wastewater statistics and policies to support Agenda 2030. The initiative will review the following sub topics:
Tackling wastewater pollution from all sources
Promoting Climate resilient wastewater infrastructure
Adopting a new inclusive policy for wastewater
Promoting good practices & stimulating investment
Towards a more-aligned international effort on wastewater
A consortium of partners will meet twice a year  and develop a refined policy document through consultation and review. Funds will be raised to support capacity-development in the area of wastewater. The work of the consortium will sahre the results of their work at major international fora","Tackling wastewater pollution from all sources
In order to better understand and quantify the problem of wastewater pollution and to make decisions about its management,the monitoring capacity of responsible authorities will be strengthened. This will include central government ministries, local authorities and environmental  protection agencies, as well as water operators and affected communities. In addition, we must include not only wastewater from all sources, but also understand the critical links to solid waste management, plastic pollution and drainage, and their combined impact of the natural environment. 
Promoting Climate resilient wastewater infrastructure
Extreme climate events have revealed that our wastewater management infrastructure is hopelessly inadequate to cope with inundation from stormwater. Uncontrolled pollution results in contamination of water sources and other natural resources. During extreme droughts, water of marginal quality could be treated and reused to augment scarce freshwater. Climate change has catalysed new thinking for the WASH. We will revisit wastewater management, overview existing systems and retrofit and modify them. Nature-based solutions can support a win-win situations where treatment costs (including energy) are reduced, while at the same time improving system capacity to manage stormwater. 
Adopting a new inclusive policy for wastewater
For too long the wastewater sector has remained divided with both wastewater and excreta from on-site systems, being considered differently from off-site, networked solutions. Aside from technical options, wastewater as a sector suffers from divided institutional responsibility. In many countries, the management of most wastewater sludges from on-site sanitation, wastewater treatment by-products and septage are overseen by different governance structures. Depending on the context, more inclusive, city-wide approaches are needed. Better local-level management will lead to improved national level impacts. Reuse of wastewater and excreta, should be considered the norm as an easily-exploited resource, more cost-effectively than other sources. 
Promoting good practices & stimulating investment
It is evident that a huge body of knowledge already exists on managing wastewater, but new approaches are also currently being advanced, both for collection and treatment of wastewater. In addition to technological advances, new governance methods are also demonstrating greater alignment and improved productivity and efficiency. Many new partnerships in the corporate sector, for example, are giving more attention to corporate social responsibility. Additionally, historic under-investment must be reversed. The conservatism of the sector needs to be overcome and strategic investments made, both in domestic resource allocation and in ODA. Wastewater-based epidemiology is also now leading the way to help us to predict and better manage future health pandemics. Platforms to share this information and to ensure that the latest approaches are included in teaching and research curriculum are lacking. 
Towards a more-aligned international effort on wastewater 
Building on the work on wastewater, and with the continued support of the co-custodians of SDG6.3 and related SDGs, the consoritum agree to regularly meet teice a year consulting and consolidate our findings, leading to a more detailed commitment on wastewater globally.

This initiative presents capacity development as key to tackling water and climate challenges, including through mitigation and adaptation, to accelerate progress towards achievement of all water- and climate-related SDGs and highlight capacity development as a game changer. When capacity development is a process that involves all segments of society (citizens, communities, schools, government agencies, the private sector and more) rather than an event that targets specific key institutions, results are tangible and lasting. In addition, game-changing capacity development takes an adaptive approach to the generation and use of knowledge, thereby enabling partners to address current and future challenges in a changing world. It will also connect this game-changing idea with the recently launched UN-Water Capacity Development Initiative (coordinated by UNESCO and UN DESA) and other relevant initiatives to explore leverage and synergies.","The cross-cutting nature of this initiative is relevant to all Interactive Dialogues, and in particular the Interactive Dialogue 5 – Water Action Decade: Accelerating the implementation of the objectives of the Decade, including through the UN Secretary-General’s Action Plan.

i)	empowering people to ensure that the transformation is implemented;
ii)	strengthening governance at all levels;
iii)	enhancing the capacity of data driven decision-making;
iv)	strengthening financial capacity; and
v)	developing sustainable infrastructure with cost effective technology.
This agenda, which will be implemented for 20 years has a strategic direction that cuts across the four Malaysia Plans. It focuses on climate change impact and adaptation on the water sector, strengthening data integration, establishing water footprint and virtual water inventory, sustainable water resources management through the implementation of Water-Food-Energy Nexus, exploring alternative water financing, introducing water as new economic sector, raising public awareness and implementing IR 4.0 in the various water sub-sectors.     
The WST 2040 proposes the adoption of smart technological advancements by increasing digitalisation and connectivity to alleviate Water-Energy-Food nexus pressure points. Water digitalisation, which can be accomplished through a single-point comprehensive data integration, strengthens governance of the water sector and facilitates the formulation of evidence-based policies.
These technological solutions are in line with the Fourth Industrial Revolution (IR 4.0), which play a critical role in maximising efficiencies and mitigating waste in the context of water and energy. These enhancements will support the efforts in tackling water security challenges and help the growth of the sector as well as creating spill-over effects such as boosting economic development.  
Although virtual water and water footprint are relatively new concepts in Malaysia, elements to support water footprint initiatives are already in place. The National Water Balance System (NAWABS) was established from the National Water Resources Policy. The system was proposed as a comprehensive river basin management instrument. Through systematic and credible databases, the water footprint inventory can serve as a guidance in identifying the optimum water allocation for domestic, industry and agriculture consumption.","The water sector will focus on ensuring water security for all until 2040. The focus will be placed on strengthening water resources governance, financial sustainability and continuous engagement with the rakyat as well as implementing the
circular economy concept in the entire sector’s value chain.
This long-term vision for water will start with accelerating the adoption of the circular economy and Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). Strengthening management of water resources and governance will better manage the trade off between water, environment and development.

This includes adopting nature-based solutions; short-term strategies to increase preparedness through periodic maintenance of flood mitigation infrastructures; long-term strategies through early warning and forecasting, development of plans and guidelines for sub-national implementation, mainstreaming of adaptation for water.  In addition, a regulatory intervention to combat climate change-related issues and effective CEPA are prerequisite to support a future proof and sustainable water management for all. 
Malaysia is adopting a total solution for identified critical and vulnerable areas, and cooperation at sub-national level will include periodic river basin maintenance.  The allocation for flood mitigation projects have been increased in the Eleventh (2016 - 2020) and Twelfth Malaysia (2021 - 2025) plans amounting to RM19billion and coastal protection costs RM5billion. Non-structural flood mitigation includes expanding the use of Nature-based Solutions: Make Room for Water and Building with Nature. This will also include adoption of Integrated Water Resources Management, Integrated River Basin Management and Integrated Flood Management; increasing water retention capacity; resettlement programmes for floodplain areas to reduce disaster risks; and gazetting river reserve, flood prone areas and wetlands as flood mitigation areas.
Malaysia is looking to increase the average recurrence interval level of flood and coastal protection structures by including the climate change factors in the design of these structures. Development is approached with resilience where flood hazard and risks maps are shared to relevant agencies to ensure adaptation and disaster risk reduction for flood is mainstreamed.","The rise of the average annual surface temperature will reach between 1.9 to 2.1°C by the end of the century. With the increase in temperature, the change of average annual precipitation is also expected to increase between 14% to 25%. Malaysia will also see the increase in sea level to about 0.7m by the end of the 21st century.
With climate change, more areas and populations will be made vulnerable to the risks of flood. This could potentially impact the country’s economy especially agriculture, industry, tourism and energy, and disproportionately impact the population.

This in turn, contributes to the fulfillment of SDG 6 and other targets related to water.
The outcomes of monitoring indicator 6.5.1 ""degree of implementation of IWRM (0-100)"" are being used by countries to identify their challenges and establish roadmaps that respond to priorities and national contexts, while facilitating institutional synergies to accelerate IWRM implementation and catalyze the fulfillment of SDG 6 in general and contribute to mobilize other development goals, within the framework of the Water Action Decade.   
GWP has supported all countries in Central American to engage in multi-stakeholder and multisectoral consultation processes through the application of the evaluation methodology for indicator SDG 6.5.1, ensuring that all water voices provide opinions, inputs, and recommendations on ways to move forward towards water security with an IWRM approach.   
To respond to the main challenges and gaps identified through this evaluation process, GWP will provide advice and technical assistance to Ministries of Environment and other related institutions from the water sector for the uptake and consideration of these inputs into policy processes, as well as the preparation of planning and management instruments such as the IWRM Action Plans. Likewise, GWP will assist institutions in the identification of partners and the creation of alliances for coordination, implementation and overcoming the existing financial gap for IWRM in the region, with particular attention to the IWRM Action Plans.  
As part of water governance strengthening at all levels, GWP will continue to promotes a pilot initiative for the IWRM evaluation at subnational levels (municipal and basin level), through the adaptation of the methodology used at national level, which is being applied in several municipalities in Honduras and Nicaragua. This contributes to the scope of IWRM implementation and accelerate change towards SDG 6 achievement at all levels. GWP will continue supporting these exercises in the region.","Water is undoubtedly a catalyzer of social and economic development of countries, advancing in its integrated management is consistent with the commitments and goals established in the 2030 National Agendas linked to SDGs, which will drive the well-being of populations, improve governance and sustainable provision of ecosystem services that support life, health, and development.
The preparation of IWRM Action Plans, based on the results of the SDG 6.5.1 evaluation, identifies water interactions and aids in the establishment of achievable goals that consider the priorities of different sectors to improve the availability and access of the resource in quality and quantity. It is also a step forward in providing basic services for urban and rural communities with a Human Rights approach, in addition to productive and environmental uses – considering the five Valuing Water Principles. The consultation processes, facilitates joint construction and management that will reflect in the acceleration of SDG 6 implementation, with a contribution to the fulfillment of other related SDGs.
The expected impacts of IWRM implementation in countries are as follows:
- Prioritized interventions are implemented focusing on interinstitutional coordination, collaborative technical support, and innovative financial mechanisms throughout countries.
- Consultation and evaluation mechanisms are put in place and maintained to provide an inclusive voice to water stakeholders to express their needs and expected benefits.
- National Water Policies and management instruments are developed through participatory consultation processes, which can be replicated and generate benefits at subnational level.
- Institutional capacities are improved through advice, technical assistance, and support in financial management to tackle local, bilateral, or multilateral financial opportunities to implement action plans and similar instruments.","SDG 6 IWRM Support Programme (UNEP, UNEP-DHI Center and GWP)

Many local people, especially in Kyrgyzstan's rural regions, as in other Central Asian (CA) countries, require proper access to new innovative technologies and renewed ancient and international knowledge. The proper user-friendly TVET (technical and vocational education and training) support is required to adapt the scientific and advanced technological programs for local communities, the scientific works and recommendations should be accessible and understandable to most people. In a chaotic and huge flow of information, society has been divided into many parts in CA and lost contact with each other, which leads to undesirable and unexpected consequences for the whole society. The permanent updating of TVET support is required to expand in CA. We are working on setting up the TVET Foundation program for the Kyrgyzstan Naryn region to mitigate floods-droughts with a Sustainable Agriculture application. Emergency events (EE), including floods-droughts, are frequent every year in CA. Most of the EE support is provided after the EE occurrence, without the proper proactive emergency preparedness, including prediction analysis, and TVET preparations. Many international organizations, UN recommend providing substantial support in the proactive EE programs to reduce the consequences of emergencies, which saves expenses five to ten times: “Every $1 Invested in Disaster Mitigation Saves $6”. Another issue in CA, EE mitigation activities with sustainable agriculture should be properly connected to biodiversity issues. Communities and farmers are competing with nature, “ fully 90% of all protected areas adjoin farmland”. Communities and farmers have difficulties using the marginal lands profitably, which is why people are often trying to get natural resources from the protected areas, competing with nature and different species. The efficient water usage for the marginal lands with profitable crop productions, such as quinoa, and amaranth should mitigate these competition issues of communities, and farmers with nature. The proper promotion for EE mitigation, agro modeling, and prediction analysis is required. The main team-building activities with setting up the connected Communities - School - Biodiversities - College - Industry - University (CSBSIU) cooperation will be reasonable to expand starting from the basic TVET Foundation program, which we are missing in CA now.
The New Global Framework for Managing Nature meeting, which was hosted in Canada, in December 2022, resulted in adoption of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF).

We propose to develop Hydrogen and Ammonia production within the Naryn river basin region, by using the collected flood water and chain of the solar-wind-small hydropower stations. The electricity and water resources will be with reasonable expenses in the Naryn river basin. The Hydrogen technologiesTVET support could be in cooperation with developing countries, which are already developed, and Hydrogen applications, including EU, UK, Canada, USA, Japan, South Korea, Singapore, China, and other countries, which may have interests to cooperate with us. For example, the Japanese Toshiba company already tested container-based Hydrogen production technologies  https://www.global.toshiba/ww/news/corporate/2015/04/pr2001.html for more than seven years. A similar approach could be set up for the pilot testing facilities along the Naryn river basin with potential expansion on the bigger facilities. Hydrogen and Ammonia fertilizers will be produced and used directly by farmers.  Farmers will receive hydrogen energy for their engines, machines, tractors, and irrigation systems. This output water needs to be enriched in the proper concentration of the right amount of fertilizers for the dedicated type of farmer crops, including quinoa, where Ammonia could be used, it could be developed in cooperation with Drip, Pivot irrigation technologies producers such as  Valmont Valley Irrigation Company, http://www.irrigation.education/. The Ammonia fertilizers production could be in cooperation with Kazphosphate  https://www.kpp.kz/.  Kazphosphate is the leading company for the manufacture of phosphorus-containing products in the center of the Eurasian continent. Hydrogen and Ammonia fertilizers will be purchased by CA region farmers. Drip, Pivot irrigation technologies will benefit from the clean Hydrogen energy and high-quality Ammonia fertilizers application for their capillary spraying systems without clogging their pipes.
 All these efforts require the proper TVET capacity-building support to use these new sources of energy, and fertilizers for farmers. The balanced use of natural resources, and sustainable use of mineral fertilizers, combined with eco-friendly technologies, including sustainable water usage, and a responsible attitude to nature, and biodiversity, are required the proper knowledge, and advanced irrigation technologies with scientific and TVET support.

            Critical academic outputs on water governance challenges i.e publications, webinars, workshops, science-policy interface talks",Academic/scientific community,"Netherlands, Spain, Sweden","Africa, Europe, Asia and Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, Global","We are a group of 15 Early Stage Researchers of the NEWAVE Network, covering 15 research projects on water governance in Europe, Asia, Latin America and East Africa. To accelerate achievement of SDG 6 and of the Water Action agenda, there is a need to include reflexive thinking in research and in the implementation of water agendas. We have identified several gaps in the global water governance system that are hindering progress towards equitable, just, and sustainable governance of complex water problems and the achievement of SDG 6. The key issue we highlight here is the limited reflexivity in both academic and policy arenas on who is doing water governance, how it is being done, and for what purpose. Disciplinary silos, combined with distrust, vested interests, and unequal power dynamics between different groups, has resulted in a limited reflection amongst water governance actors on:
•	Dominant approaches and paradigms in water governance (i.e. neo-liberal perspectives, integrated water resource management, ideas around efficiency and control, commodification) go largely unquestioned, whereas the transformative potential of critical thinking (i.e. feminist, political ecology, post-colonial theories) is subdued under these paradigms as a marginal narrative;
•	The power dynamics between actors, as certain stakeholders continue to be underrepresented, unable to access decision-making processes (even those deemed ‘open and accessible’), and are ultimately (un/intentionally) re-portrayed as recipients of ‘solutions’ and policies designed by ‘experts’ and based on technical expert-knowledge;
•	The limits to accessibility on water data and how this affects decision-making processes, particularly as disclosure and transparency on data and its collection methods are crucial for actionable water governance.
We are committed to fostering reflexivity in our role as academics, researchers, and practitioners working on water challenges, and to incorporate greater reflection in our practices pushing forward 7 actions to influence the direction of the Water Action Agenda. We do this to create spaces for transparent, just, and accountable forms of water governance to emerge.","1.	Address the limitations of academic institutions within which research in ‘remote laboratories’ is upheld as more ‘objective’ than action-research and co-creation approaches. These limitations  are particularly problematic when academics from the ‘Global North’ conduct research in the ‘Global South’ as it replicates a colonial and extractive approach to knowledge accumulation - about which many critical researchers are sounding alarm bells. How can researchers build ethical and sustained partnerships (with institutional support) with local actors/ institutions?
2.	It is important to acknowledge and question biases of what research is considered useful, neutral, or legitimate. In the water field, more ‘objective’ and positivist modes of research are often considered to have higher eligibility for grants, permits, requests for information, and access to participants. In some sectors (i.e. development organizations), there might also be implicit or explicit pressure to emphasize ‘successful’ interventions, rather than admitting challenges.
3.	Critically engage with information collection practices. Collected water data is often based on limited parameters and intended to meet specific purposes. Data are frequently not made available to stakeholders, the broader public, or research communities. An immense amount of knowledge is kept within the walls of financial, governmental, and private institutions. How do dominant paradigms determine what data is collected and for what purpose? 
4.	Acknowledge the connections of water and land. Most research on water governance treats water as H2O or, in recent systems approaches, as a component of the water-energy-food nexus. The connection between the socio-ecological and political links of land and water often remain under-researched, which de-politicizes historical-material processes and invisibilizes/ justifies practices such as land grabbing. Re-politicizing water and land entanglements can shed light on a blind spot of water governance research.
5.	Critically reflect on the limitations of institutions. Water challenges are becoming increasingly complex with the impacts of climate change placing stress on existing institutions. Existing legal frameworks– from access rights to environmental migration policies– must be re-imagined and re-crafted to meet the challenges of today. As researchers on water governance, how can we shed light on such limitations of institutions? How can we better visualize locally-situated experiments that are challenging/ overcoming barriers of legal frameworks and institutions? 
6.	Complexify and challenge binaries in water governance research. Common binaries include formal-informal; control-chaos; technical-political; public-private or the public-commons; science-policy; science-activism, and human-non-human among others. More fluid research that challenges these binaries and boundaries is needed. For instance, informality often remains negatively depicted or invisibilized, but how might it help overcome service gaps and limitations in legal rights that leave behind certain groups?  
7.	Reflect on how metrics are designed and leveraged to promote certain policies or paradigms. Metrics, used to measure the impact/ outcomes of developmental interventions, infrastructure projects, policy or legislation, are not neutral but inherently political and driven by particular paradigms. Can we measure what it means for water governance approaches to be more ‘just’ and ‘equitable’ and if so, how? How can we simultaneously embrace plurality and resist the pressures to generalize or scale up?","Fundation Nueva Cultura del Agua, Global Water Partnership",Goal 6,"6.1 , 6.6, 6.b","Fri, 03/24/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 12/24/2024 - 12:00",https://www.nextwatergovernance.net,0.375,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.16483516483516544

REGIONAL ADVOCACY “POSITION TO INFLUENCE”: We promote the Amazon as a key region for the planet, and position local strategies implemented by the indigenous peoples to protect the forest ́s integrity , in political agendas that are of relevance for the region, through the implementation of escalated advocacy strategies, based on indigenous peoples and local communitie’s knowledge, governance and management systems.","The North Amazon Alliance commits to promote the protection of the Amazonian Flying Rivers, and to contribute to the saveguard of ecosystem and sociocultural connectivity in hand with indigenous peoples and local communities in the region in order to protect the integrity of the Amazon as an effective means to keep the global water cycles in place. We are united by the vision that the forests, rivers and cultures in the Amazon are connected to enhance planetary wellbeing. We seek cultural, social, and ecological connectivity to safeguard the integri- ty of the Amazon, and its relationship with the Andes and the Atlantic to ensure the Andes-Amazon-Atlantic system ́s role in regulating the global climate and the water cycle, among other life support systems that guarantee planetary wellbeing and resilience. Our starting point are the territorial strategies that we accompany, with the commitment to value and position the indigenous knowledge systems on which these are based, approaching these from an intercultural approach. We accompany the definition and implementation of community management self-defined planning tools. The challenge: the integrity of the largest and best preserved tropical forest in the world is at risk.

            A global campaign to bring our rivers back to life backed by over 560,000 citizens from all UN member states.",Our 70 million people community from around the world.,Global,Global,"The global civic movement Avaaz will mobilise its membership of 70 million people around the world to secure urgent government action to protect and restore freshwater ecosystems in the face of the climate and biodiversity crises, aiming for at least 50% conservation of all lands and inland waters to secure just and fair access to water. Over 560,000 citizens from all UN member states have already backed a call to bring our rivers back to life. This requires protecting the human right to water, and ensuring freshwater ecosystems are equitably governed and sustainably managed, with the full and effective participation of women, youth, indigenous peoples, and local communities. Avaaz will support water defenders on the front lines of this global crisis fighting back against the privatisation and commodification of water for profit: Water is life, and it must be preserved for generations to come. Avaaz will work with countries ready to champion the restoration of freshwater ecosystems, to push all governments to do their part to ensure their preservation for the sake of life on Earth. We are already working with Brazil, Burundi, Chad, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, Gabon, Germany, Mexico, Spain and The Netherlands, who have received this global campaign at the UN Water Conference (2023). We will use future multilateral and national forums to deliver this campaign on behalf of citizens all around the world, and urge more governments to join. Avaaz will continue to work with water defenders, indigenous peoples, and local communities, to elevate and materialise the historic vision of the Water Justice Manifesto, already backed by over 500 organisations, and delivered at the 2023 UN Water Conference.","Avaaz will continue to bring citizens voices to the international water agenda, to reverse decades of corporate-led conferences, and ensure that water defenders, frontline communities, and indigenous peoples, are at the heart of the decision-making process. Our movement will use this and our other people-powered campaigns to deepen the integration of global efforts and policies to tackle the climate, biodiversity and water crises - all caused by humanity’s predation over precious and fragile ecosystems, at the expense of local communities and future generations. From multilateral and national conferences on climate or biodiversity, finance and governance, Avaaz will work with its wide network of partners and allies, to demand the acceleration of political action in line with science during this decisive decade, to stop and reverse the degradation of vital ecosystems.","The Indigenous Peoples of Africa Co-ordinating Committee (IPACC)

We do this by actively driving the global conversation around ecocide law and its potential; and by convening and mapping diplomatic collaboration and progress towards adoption of the law.  In the last 4 years we have been instrumental in bringing this topic from a virtually non-existent conversation to one being discussed in parliaments and governments in dozens of countries, as well as the EU and Council of Europe.
Our core strategy involves cultivating organic global webs of relationships and expertise, nurturing and galvanizing cross-sector collaborations; impactful high-level convening; and providing compelling and appropriate communication around ecocide law in all these contexts. We are well positioned to do this, as our activities straddle legal developments, diplomatic advocacy and public narrative.
Progress on this is measured by: state interest in ecocide law and use of the international legal definition emerging from the Independent Expert Panel convened by us; political and influencer support; discussion and support at the International Criminal Court and (eg) UN contexts; funder support; media coverage; public, academic and professional discussions on ecocide law; cross-sector partnerships, networks and high-level events around the subject of ecocide law.
Ultimately it is “followed up” by observing legislation being considered or actually in progress.
In close partnership with the government of Vanuatu, we expect to gather broad global diplomatic support over 2023-4, leading to a) a multi-state announcement of support for an international crime of ecocide simultaneously at COP28 in Dubai and at the International Criminal Court’s Assembly of States Parties in New York and b) formal steps towards negotiation of an amendment text to the Rome Statute to include ecocide by the end of 2024.","This intiative will accelerate - either directly or indirectly, a great many of the SDG targets:

Targets 6.6, 15.1-15.5 - ecocide law will directly protect and conserve ecosystems by deterring unlawful or wanton acts leading to severe and either widespread or long-term harm to any entire ecosystem or including wanton extinction of species.
Targets 12.6, 12.c, 13.2, 16.b, 17.13, 17.14 - ecocide law will encourage sustainable practices and policies and their coherence regionally and globally, including encouraging reduction of harmful subsidies and supporting macroeconomic stability, by creating parameters which assist in stabilising investment, operational and reputational risk while preventing and deterring dangerous and destructive practices.
Targets 14.c, 15.7, 16.3-5 - ecocide law will support and strongly reinforce existing national, regional and multilateral agreements, criminal laws and regulatory frameworks pertaining to the environment and wildlife.

Objectives
- To fulfill the vision, the partnership will pursue three objectives:
- Set freshwater restoration targets and mainstream these ambitions in national policy agendas to promote policy coherence across sectors and accelerate the national-level achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals, the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, the Paris Agreement, and other multilateral frameworks.
- Collect commitments, initiatives, and actions from all the stakeholders engaged in freshwater restoration to account for their contributions and to improve planning, measuring progress and harmonizing reporting.
Mobilize resources to accelerate implementation and support members and partners to achieve their restoration targets. 
Rationale
The important role of healthy freshwater ecosystems has been recognized in key international development frameworks, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. However, responsibilities and competencies remain highly fragmented among different organizations, programs, and funds. UN–Water was created to offer a platform for discussion and coordination among different actors engaged in global water governance, but it did not manage to influence policy frameworks nor connect them with knowledge generation.
At the national level, coordination among the different actors is often difficult. Several countries still face internal siloed approaches to water management as well as challenges to mainstream the topic into national sustainable development strategies and other climate and environmental related plans. To make matters more complicated, the issue of complementarity versus duplication of national targets/commitments made under different processes remains unsolved.","Purpose
The Freshwater Challenge is a country-driven initiative that aims at leveraging the support needed to bring 300,000 km of rivers and 350 million hectares of wetlands under restoration by 2030. These figures equal 30 percent of degraded freshwater ecosystems. Based on nationally-identified priorities, the Challenge will take an inclusive and collaborative approach to implementation where governments and their partners will mobilize resources and expertise to support the definition and implementation of freshwater restoration targets and co-create solutions with indigenous people, local communities and other national and international stakeholders.
Launching at the UN Water Conference, the Action Plan defines three interrelated pillars to support the implementation of national priorities and targets by addressing long-standing gaps in freshwater ecosystem restoration, protection and sustainable management, which underpin the effective delivery of sustainable development, biodiversity, climate, and disaster risk reduction plans:
Pillar 1: Knowledge – Quantify and Prepare;
Pillar 2: Plans and Strategies – Identify and Mainstream; and
Pillar 3: Resources – Mobilize Finance.","IUCN

The New Water Paradigm shift provides a global systemic solution to water climate healing and its central role in the Earth's climate system. Keeping rainwater in the land and renewal of water retention capacity of soil and landscape worldwide renew small water cycles flow and moisture, water resources, increase carbon sequestration, decrease temperatures, create new jobs, and mitigate climate risks, such as floods, droughts and sea level rise.

Citizens, local stakeholders and public administration should actively participate on the maintenance and improvement of soil and landscape ecosystem services in the context of climate change by implementing soil adaptation and management measures along with the integrated utilization of rainwater. The recovery of the global water cycle and its balance begins with the renewal of small water cycles on continents. 

The key solution is not only to stop the drying of continents and the rise of ocean levels, but also to return water back to countries and continents by water cycles. It will restore soil and landscape ecosystem services using rainwater retention principles to renew the landscape's small water cycles to reduce floods, droughts and natural disasters. Paradoxically, in current water management we focus on a large water cycle and visible water in which water is replaced on average once every 3 months, in a small water cycle every 8 days with multiple benefits of plant water vapour, soil water infiltration and biotic pump. 

In holistic concept WEFE NEXUS, when we speak about Water, we mean Earth's water cycles being modified by humans, by Energy we discuss distribution of solar energy as well. Renewable energy resources all depend on sun and water cycle. Energy cycles of transformation and distribution of solar energy in the troposphere and landscape surface are not integrated enough into regional, national, and global decision-making on climate change mitigation and land use management policies. The water cycle's stability depends on land use, the soil's health and moisture content, rain, and vegetation.","Key indicators of soil health and climate stability include: water retention capacity of soil and landscape structures; agrochemical parameters of the soil; the proportion of vegetation cover of the soil; soil erosion and soil sealing rate; the content of organic material in the soil; land use sensible heat impact. These indicators need to be evaluated on an annual basis, as well as their trends.

KEY SOLUTIONS

1. To recognize the fundamental importance of water in the Earth's climate system and the profound impact of land use and land changes on transforming the temperature conditions, hydrology, and biodiversity.

2. To recognize that each plot of land, each square meter or acre of land impacts on the total area of the continents of 136 million km2 (excluding ice cover) in terms of climate stability and water circulation.

3. To adopt Global Programme of Action for Land Rehydration and Restoration. Small water cycles and moisture recycling on land-will stabilize climate. The ecosystems will shut down unless we start restoring land up to scale. Conserving 30% of the land is important but insufficient to avert desertification in many regions. The individual UN Member States must reverse the tipping points through land restoration.

4. To research and monitor land use and land changes (LULC) impacts on watershed hydrology and rainwater capture and as drivers of urban and agricultural heat islands contributing to climate change. 5.

The Concept aims at protecting and restoring the production capacity of soil for food and biomass production by increasing its water holding capacity and organic material content. Implementation tools for this Concept are creation and operation of the national certification system ""Carbon and Water Bank"", establishment of a unified SOIL Information and Monitoring System and the creation of the Climate Fund for Soil, which will ensure financing of ecosystem services and the landscape. It is system for the involvement of landowners and land users in sustainable forest and agricultural methods contributing to capturing carbon from the atmosphere in the soil and increasing its water-holding capacity. We support the maintenance and improvement of soil and landscape ecosystem services in the context of climate change by implementing soil adaptation and management measures along with the integrated utilization of rainwater.","The Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development of the Slovak Republic is proposing a system solution which is a crucial innovation in the agriculture policy with national and international impact. At the national level, the goal is to increase the water-retaining capacity of the soil in Slovakia at 250 million m³ by 2035, which will allow the water to be used repeatedly during the year, with each rainfall. We speak about the increase in water retention capacity to at least 50 m³ every five years on every hectare of land. This solution will thus help restore water circulation, restore small water cycles in the country, sustainable cycles of carbon, nutrients and solar energy flows in the country. We assume the water retention capacity thus increased and will be fully utilized at least 4 times per year (in practice even more).The consequence of water-retaining in the country's structures will be the gradual restoration of groundwater sources, improvement of soil moisture, increase of agricultural production, forest growth, restoration of biodiversity and reduction of floods and drought risks.","Management committee of the agricultural knowledge base NEXUS

Context and objectives
The BIO-PLATEAUX initiative aims at promoting international cooperation for the transboundary river basins of Maroni and Oyapock, where significant progress has been made over the past 4 years of collaboration between French Guiana, Suriname and the Brazilian state of Amapá. 
In a context of exceptional environmental richness and cultural diversity within both the Guiana shield and the Amazonian region, the shared basins are facing transboundary challenges:
-Lack of access to essential services (drinking water supply, sanitation and solid waste management) in isolated areas,
-Increasing pressures on water resources and aquatic environments (especially linked to illegal gold mining and overuse of sediments)
-Climate change and its consequences for the territories, with higher frequency and intensity of extreme events, including floods. 
To tackle these issues, the objective of the initiative is to establish joint governance and river basin planning, with the creation of a transboundary Observatory on water resources and aquatic biodiversity.
The collaborative work initiated in the first phase of BIO-PLATEAUX initiative (2019-2022) allowed to develop a joint knowledge and identified specific needs for future integrated water resources & aquatic biodiversity management (IWRBM) in the Maroni and Oyapock river basins. The second phase of BIO-PLATEAUX (2022-2026) is developing concrete activities to respond to these priorities.
	2. Results of Phase 1 (2019-2022)
The first Phase of BIO-PLATEAUX focused on knowledge, as a leverage basis for the IWRM long term strategy. Knowledge has been developed in three dimensions:
-to know each other better, at high level (BIO-PLATEAUX Conference in November 2019, labeled as an action of French National Plan of Biodiversity –Action N°62) and technical level, with creation of thematic technical working groups on priority issues
-to know better water resources, with strengthening interoperability, development of a joint platform for data and information sharing (www.bio-plateaux.org), consolidating the rivers monitoring networks, studies and joint campaigns,
-to make known the challenges and expectancies of the territories in an inclusive manner with populations (participative activities, water classes) and technicians (innovative studies and capacity building).
	3. Commitments for Phase 2 (2022-2026)
The Phase 1 closed on 30th April 2022 with the signature of a statement by the implementing partners. They formulated the common willingness to prepare the creation of a Transboundary Observatory. The Phase 2 focus on this Transboundary Observatory, with four components:
-Institutional prefiguration (legal, organizational, and economic studies), and proposal of participative governance schemes for the Observatory and its articulation with the existing institutional framework of transboundary basin,
-Animation of the network of actors, with International Conference, participative activities in coordination with local authorities and autochthonous communities, territorial workshops, identification of priority joint projects, awareness raising, and articulation with the Amazonian basin,
-Knowledge and studies, with 3 main technical working groups on hydrology & risks; pollution, quality of aquatic environments & aquatic biodiversity; and essential services (drinking water supply, sanitation, solid waste management),
-River basin planning, starting with defining a joint methodology, prepare baseline, common diagnosis on the basin and definition of joint objectives.","This action will be a real accelerator for SDG implementation in the Guiana shield. For SDG n°6 and n°15, challenges are shared by all the territories. No long term solution would be found in the region without sustainable transboundary cooperation, which requires adapted governance, citizen participation, knowledge management and river basin planning. 
This long term process will be a concrete support to achievements of SDG on essential services (drinking water supply, sanitation, hygiene, solid waste management) in isolated areas. It will address issues at basin level for water resources & aquatic biodiversity management (reduce contaminations and improve water quality, limit use of sediment, know better to protect stronger natural habitats and biodiversity). 
One of the main difficulty identified in Phase 1 was the compartmentalization of responses (within and between countries), although territorial challenges are in facts intertwined. This has been a genuine limitation to achievements of SDGs. The transboundary Observatory will furthermore be a concrete and sustainable instrument to strengthen cooperation in the area, in order to promote an integrated vision. Thus “Interlinkage” is a core objective of this initiative, to avoid sectorial and partial approach, and promote interinstitutional articulation, thematic integration and citizen participation.
Participation will be an important objective of the initiative, to prepare the creation of an inclusive Observatory, including autochthonous populations who are living in the transboundary basins, water and aquatic biodiversity users, in close coordination with local authorities and municipalities. 
Innovation will also be a keyword of the initiative, with promotion of both:
-nature based solutions, considering remarkable ecosystem services provided by the Guiana shield at global level (ecosystem services of regulation ; water cycle ; amazon rainforest green carbon capture ; blue carbon sinks with mangroves and aquatic biodiversity), and at local level (risk vulnerability reduction ; natural purification of environment ; provisioning services ; cultural services).
-new disruptive technologies (monitoring of the hydrology of rivers with satellite spatial altimetry; and monitoring of aquatic biodiversity with methods of environmental-DNA), already developed at pilot level in French Guiana, that will be promoted by the project, shared to the neighbors, and integrated to the observatory as operational tools with studies, training and outreach. They could contribute to future solutions in other regions of the world. 
In addition, the initiative is holding strong assets:
-BIO-PLATEAUX is supported and promoted by authorities of the three beneficiary territories, with involvement of stakeholders at national and territorial levels,
-the initiative is financed by a group of donors (see below),
-activities are consistent with legal framework of each country, and are actually part of the French Guiana river basins management plan (SDAGE, with legal scope).","Guiana Water Office (OEG), France

A disconnect between the ocean and freshwater management communities is exacerbating this threat leading to insufficient political and financial investment in safeguarding the services that the water systems, from the source to the sea, provide. The disconnects in policy development and implementation among basin, coastal, and marine areas lead to management failures, which result in issues such as pollution, alterations in water and sediment flows, loss of biodiversity, and habitat fragmentation etc., with severe impacts on freshwater and marine ecosystems.  
Global Water Partnership (GWP), UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC-UNESCO) and the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) commit to implementing the Healthy Rivers Healthy Oceans Program, which has been endorsed as a formal contribution to the UN Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. The programme, which will run from 2023 to 2030, will implement science, governance and technological solutions that consider the interdependencies between land, freshwater, coastal, and ocean systems, to advance the achievement of the freshwater- and ocean-related SDGs, notably SDG6 and SDG14. The programme will be structured around the three pillars of: (i) innovation and capacity development across the science-policy interface, (ii) enabling action in source-to-sea management and governance, and (iii) addressing pollution, and enhancing governance in international source-to-sea systems. Knowledge management and capacity development will be core, cross-cutting themes of the programme as will the identification and filling of critical science and knowledge gaps. Actions undertaken by the core programme partners i.e. GWP, UNESO-IOC and SIWI, will be complemented by new initiatives and actions solicited through the framework of the UN Ocean Decade and led by diverse groups of actors that convene around the programme objectives to co-design and co-deliver solutions. Together, the programme initiatives and actions will reduce unsustainable land and water resources management induced pressures on river basins, seas and the ocean, that lead to ecosystem degradation and socio-economic consequences.","Activities under the Healthy Rivers Healthy Oceans Program (HRHO) programme aim to foster concerted action between the ocean and freshwater communities for an integrated response towards sustainable natural resources management from source to sea, and for the achievement of SDG 6 and SDG 14 as well as the 2030 Agenda overall.
Action is organized around three pillars and grouped in three components. 
1. The first component is envisaged to address critical capacity shortcomings at the science-policy-management interface to enable informed source-to-sea management and financing/investment decisions.  Cost effective and sustainable monitoring of the state of the fresh and marine water systems will be fostered through the testing and promotion/up-scaling of artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML) solutions that will supplement existing monitoring systems. 
 2. Source-to-sea action will be enabled -under the second component- through the identification/development of national and regional level commitments in the form of policy frameworks and strategic documents for the holistic management of land, freshwater, coastal, and marine systems. As a prerequisite to the development of commitments, improved awareness of the need for and benefits of implementing source-to-sea management at regional, national, and sub-national levels will be fostered. Further, capacity development of public, private, and civil society actors to promote and undertake coordinated management of basins/aquifers, coasts and the ocean through source-to-sea action will be pursued. Inclusive, participatory approaches will be used to ensure that all voices are heard in decision making.  
 3. Addressing pollution in source-to-sea systems falls under the third component of the program. Partners will work in selected source-to-sea systems to identify and implement measures to address pollution-related pressures and effects. Improved source-to-sea governance will be necessary in this regard; in systems involving transboundary waters and/or international seas the establishment of scaled institutional and legal arrangements will be sought. 
 As a flagship source-to-sea initiative of the Ocean Decade, the program will make a substantive contribution to the vision and mission of the Decade and support the co-design and co-delivery of transformative ocean science solutions that contribute to sustainable development. Furthermore, the program will support the formation of foundational aspects that will enable a holistic source-to-sea governance in specific locations. These may include, in addition to increased awareness and the development of policies, also frameworks that provide resources and mechanisms for coordination among sectors, increased inclusion of upstream and downstream interests in decision making, and stronger linkages between the freshwater, coastal and ocean communities.","GWP submits this commitment on behalf of UNESCO IOC, Stockholm International Water Institute","Goal 6, Goal 8, Goal 9, Goal 11, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 14, Goal 15, Goal 17","6.1 , 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 8.4, 9.4, 11.6, 12.2, 12.4, 12.5, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 14.1, 14.2, 14.5, 14.c, 15.1, 15.5, 15.9, 15.a, 17.6, 17.9, 17.14, 17.16, 17.17","Wed, 03/01/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2030 - 12:00",,0.875,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3296703296703309

            Water Stress Map for China's Dairy Industry",local watersheds,China,Asia and Pacific,"A study based on the global milk supply in 2018 demonstrated that 628 liters of water are required to produce one liter of cow milk. In addition to milk, other dairy products that use milk as the main raw material, such as yogurt, milk powder, ice cream, cheese, etc., will consume more water per unit of product due to the water footprint of the production process and other ingredients added. Yili Group has breakdown water use in all sectors of its value chain with full life cycle assessment and is the first company in the dairy industry to propose the ""Low Water Footprint Initiative"". The dairy industry's ""low water footprint initiative"" is in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6 (SDGs 6). Which is by 2030, substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate. To further analyze the water stress areas where Yili and its suppliers are located, Yili Group adopted the Aqueduct tool of the World Resources Institute, combined with the available water remaining (AWARE) tool developed by the WULCA Working Group of the UNEP-SETAC Lifecycle Initiative. The water stress map generated by Yili helps formulate value chain water conservation goals and plan targeted activities, such as water conservation projects and best practices within its facilities. The continuous reduction of the water footprint of Yili products helps alleviate the pressure on water resources in high-risk areas. In 2022, Yili Group aimed at regions with a high risk of water stress, sorted out water-saving potentials and carried out 322 water-saving projects, involving various products such as mineral water, milk powder, liquid milk, yogurt, and ice cream products, covering all factories. In 2022, the percentage of water consumption from alternative water sources is 4.07% and the total water-saving reached 1.7 million tons. The water resources stewardship of Yili Group is based on the self-developed digital platform. This platform not only manage the data of all water intake, water consumption and water recycling, but also be able to calculate the water footprint of the product life cycle according to international standards. Yili works with independent third-party verification and certification to make sure the digital platform is capable to provide the solid foundation for better management of water risks. In order to promote the ""low water footprint initiative"", Yili established a value chain alliance with 43 strategic partners in 2022. In addition to setting its own water-saving goals, it also formulated water-saving plans for value chain companies and rewarded companies that reduce their water footprints according to the plan. From the product design stage, relying on the digital water management platform, predict the water footprint of new factories and newly planned products in advance, so as to reduce the water footprint both at the product and organizational levels. The monitoring mechanism is set up to regularly check the performance of water-saving best practices and promote them.","Through the LWF initiative (LWFi), Yili will not only achieve a reduction in water consumption in its own production, but also gradually expand alternative water consumption to gradually reduce water intake and mitigate the impact of its own operations on water resources. On the other hand, through value chain alliances, promote suppliers to achieve the goal of reducing water consumption for production water, establish standards to measure the performance of the water footprint of raw materials, and achieve an overall trend of reducing the water footprint of dairy products throughout the product lifecycle, reducing scarcity pressure on local water resources.","Youran Dairy（内蒙古优然牧业有限责任公司）

To ensure sustainability and impact the focus is on actions that are locally replicable and scalable through institutionalized methodologies and practices.
SDGs 6 (sustainable management of water) and 16 (inclusive societies, and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions) are highlighted in the approach to sustainability of the sector from both a perspective on social as well as institutional sustainability: social sustainability on the one hand to ensure that service providers in the sector have the capacity to act in a responsive manner to the needs and input of their communities in order to provide quality services, where citizens are not subjected to structural obstacles related to e.g. health in WASH as well as participation in determining service provision needs; institutional sustainability on the other hand to ensure that relevant institutions, policies, and procedures at local level are functional and meet the needs of users of WASH services, wherein the actors are clear on their roles and are capacitated to fulfil those roles effectively through a clear multi-stakeholder approach.
Through a Water Operators Partnership established with Dutch Water Partners and the local water companies, the water board Brabantse Delta and drinking water company Brabant Water and their extensive network of water operators in the Netherlands, the project takes a peer-to-peer approach to institutional knowledge transfer with Egyptian water companies. With a focus on cross-stakeholder and inter-governorate knowledge exchange, the project aims to allow for uptake of good and new practices shared across regions, for replication and scale-up in other regions, for multiplication of exchange of good practices and learnings.","The SDGs are a basis for both the implementation and M&E framework of the project. They are an integral component globally for the development of the sustainability of WASH and climate adaptation, as well as a basis of Dutch development cooperation. 
The project's focus, lying in the nexus of social and institutional sustainability with actions targeting community engagement in the target Governorates in Upper Egypt as well as technical assistance in water management of the local water companies, works to synergize between actions, actors, levels of governance, to support achievement of SDGs:
- Contribute to the need for more efficient water and resource allocation in face of climate and desertification challenges in Egypt.
- Analyze where risks for water availability and social and environmental impacts emerge and supporting in how to invest in more efficient systems/practices to reduce those risks on water shortages.
- Support to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the Government of Egypt's investments in the WASH sector in the target regions.
- Develop and strengthen the responsiveness of local government and Water and Sanitation Companies to communities in WASH services.
- Produce replicable solutions which can be rolled out to other Governorates and regions.
- Connect those solutions with the SDGs in the Governorate Strategic Plans 2030 and raise the awareness of the stakeholders to the SDGs.","Funded by the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands; Implemented in partnership with Dutch Water Partners Brabantse Delta (Water Board of Province of North Brabant) and Brabant Water (Drinking Water Company of Province of North Brabant); Implemented with the support of the Egyptian Ministry of Local Development, the Egyptian Ministry of Housing, Utilities, and Urban Communities, and the Egyptian Holding Company for Water and Wastewater","Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 16","5.5, 6.1 , 6.4, 16.6, 16.7","Fri, 10/01/2021 - 12:00","Sun, 03/31/2024 - 12:00",,0.375,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

It works towards the fulfilment of human rights to water and sanitation (HRWS), prioritizing the most fragile countries and the most vulnerable populations, with the aim of reducing pockets of poverty and inequality.
The Fund essentially focuses on programmes to provide sustainable services through infrastructure that guarantees access to water and sanitation; through strengthening public management systems that are efficient, transparent, and participatory; and through capacity-building in the public institutions and organizations of recipient countries.
In recent years, FCAS has redoubled its efforts regarding Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), strengthening water institutions, and supporting the rollout of comprehensive public policies in the sector. These interventions have the ultimate purpose of guaranteeing the human right to water and sanitation, and contributing to achieving the 2030 Agenda; specifically, Sustainable Development Goal 6 (ensure safe drinking water and sanitation for all).
The Fund has a global portfolio of 83 programmes: 25 of them are currently in execution and three in a design phase. The others have already finished. These programmes have worked in 18 countries (currently 15)  of Latin America and the Caribbean, with a special emphasis on peri-urban and rural areas, as well as indigenous peoples (such as the Malecu people in Costa Rica, Garífunas in Honduras or Mam, in Gutemala). The countries that have obtained the most FCAS funds are Haiti, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Guatemala
The Fund began its work at the end of 2009. To date, it has disbursed nearly €800 million in grants which have in turn attracted €800 million in local matching funds for implementing programmes. In total, more than €1.6 billion. Since then, it has forged a high-profile role in international forums and institutional dialogue in the region to improve the water and sanitation sector.
Today, the FCAS has created synergies with other actors in the sector, and its commitment to partnerships has driven complementary actions on aspects that FCAS did not address initially, and on public policies in need of support. The Great Fund is the name given to the sum of all water and sanitation initiatives in which the Spanish Agency for International Development Cooperation (AECID) participates, multiplying the impact of the original FCAS through instruments such as technical cooperation, reimbursable cooperation, delegation of EU funds, etc. In particular, FONPRODE (Development Promotion Fund) complements the FCAS portfolio by funding with reimbursable funds new projects or second phases of the Water Fund programmes, following the same guidelines and approaches as the Fund.","By the end of 2021, the Fund has directly benefited more than 4 million people: 3.5 million have received access to new or refurbished drinking water services; more than 1.4 million to sanitation services; 961,000 have treated wastewater; and more than 79,000 people have received training in water services management. Moreover, awareness-raising campaigns on hygiene and water resources use have reached at least 1.6 million people.  
Currently, there are still 28 programmes running, with an estimated budget of 200 € million (215 $ million), and the expected impact of the whole FCAS activity is to benefit more than 5 million people in total by 2026. 
These interventions are complemented by institutional capacity-building actions and support for comprehensive public policies, national planning, and sector-wide strategies. In addition to the quantitative impacts, it is essential to note the work done in strengthening the sector and the impact on public policies. This is key to ensure the sustainability of programmes and, for the Water Fund, this line of work is of strategic importance due to its contribution to the achievement of the SDGs in the region and the fulfilment of Human Rights to Water and Sanitation.
The issues addressed in this aspect include support to partner countries in adopting specific measures to improve their water governance policies. This has involved specialised support for the development of the legal and institutional framework of countries with an Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) approach, both in terms of strategic and hydrological planning and institutional capacity-building.","Inter-American Development Bank

            2.	Advocate for greater investment and coordination by the Government of Canada as a duty bearer for ensuring the right to health and water in its delivery of international programs. A focus will be on investing in water to endure health for all",People at risk of and affected by Neglected Tropical Diseases,Canada,North America,"The Canadian Network for NTDs will advocate for water, sanitation and hygiene as a human right, as well as a critical pathway towards the sustainable achievement of the WHO NTD Roadmap 2030 goals; in addition to SDG3 – Health for All, among other sustainable development goals. 
Note: Early work in WASH and NTDs advocacy began in 2022 during World Water Week with the development of this joint statement, followed by the endorsement of a second statement that year during COP27 on Women and Water on the frontline of climate change; and has continued in 2023 with engagement in this UN Water Conference and supporting and endorsing this Open Letter calling on the Canadian government to make a commitment to SDG6 at the conference.  
The Canadian Network for NTDs primarily engages in advocacy to raise awareness of both the scale and depth of NTDs as a global public health issue within Canada; and to secure increased commitments and contributions from the Canadian government towards NTD prevention and treatment strategies. NTDs require multi-sectoral strategies to be effective and sustainable, particularly when considering NTD elimination as the end-goal. All NTDs require clean water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) for their treatment and prevention. Water, sanitation and hygiene as a human right, as well as a critical pathway towards the sustainable achievement of the WHO NTD Roadmap 2030 goals; in addition to SDG3 – Health for All, among other sustainable development goals. Indeed, most NTDs would not exist as diseases of public health concern if communities affected by NTDs had sustainable access to WASH at home, school, work, within health care facilities, and within the community more broadly. 
To support its NTD advocacy within Canada, The Canadian Network for NTDs will advocate for water, sanitation and hygiene as a human right, as well as a critical pathway towards the sustainable achievement of the WHO NTD Roadmap 2030 goals; and achieving Health for All (SDG3).  This advocacy will raise awareness among Canadian Civil Society about the impact of access to WASH on the health of communities affected by NTDs, and promote the integration of WASH by the Government of Canada as critical to achieving sustainable results through its global health investments.  
To support this advocacy, Canadian Network for NTDs will use existing  international days (ie: World NTD Day/World Water Day), partnerships within the Network, frameworks and mechanisms, such as the WHO Global Strategy on WASH to Combat NTDs companion document as an advocacy tool/ and the Canada Water Agency once established to support this advocacy work.","The Government of Canada has historically deprioritized the right to clean water and sanitation both at home and abroad. There is a continued need to inform, engage and mobilize civil society to unite behind SDG6 to influence the Government to invest and take action on ensuring equal access to clean water and sanitation to support health for all. This includes improving WASH for people and communities living with and at risk of NTDs (including for people with NTD-acquired disabilities), which is expected to result in a reduction of the disease burden of NTDs. 
The expected impact of this initiative overall is to see the government of Canada taking decisive action towards SDG6 both at home and abroad.",The Canadian Network will engage its Network members and other interested civil society actors in these advocacy efforts,"Goal 3, Goal 6, Goal 10","3.3, 6.2, 10.2","Fri, 03/31/2023 - 12:00","Fri, 03/29/2024 - 12:00",,0.125,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

The next four years, which will overlap with the Lula administration, will be key for achieving this target, which is why our commitment extends over this period.

Instituto Água e Saneamento (Water and Sanitation Institute), acronym IAS, is a Brazilian nonprofit organization founded in 2019. Our work is driven by two beliefs. The first is that universal access to water and sanitation is possible and urgent. The second is that we must build ""bridges"" and foster cooperation to be able to overcome this challenge.

The IAS seeks to draw attention to the various aspects of water and sanitation, with the belief that: “Water and sanitation are a human right, a public policy, an essential service, a matter of public health, and must be adapted to local conditions.” Our actions follow three key strategies: 1) ""Know the problem to build solutions"": organize, produce and disseminate up-to-date information broken down by municipality and accessible to different audiences; 2) ""A Bottom-Up Approach to Water and Sanitation”: increasing access to water and sanitation from within Brazil, contributing to the development of solutions in these two areas; and 3) Networking: fostering dialogue through multi-sector coordination between social actors, academics, and the public and private sectors, in order to develop a positive networking agenda.

Over the next four years we intend to: 

1 - Produce and systematize knowledge through annual IAS publications addressing the main developments in relation to water and sanitation in Brazil.

2 - Spread knowledge and create spaces for dialogue by organizing seminars, technical gatherings and dialogue rounds, with the aim of reaching different audiences, including technical experts in water and sanitation, academics, journalists, activists, and the general public.

3 - Monitor Brazil’s Sanitation Legal Framework and disseminate knowledge through digital platforms, such as the “Legal Framework Observatory”, “Legal Framework Data Panel” and “Municipalities and Water and Sanitation”, all of which are available on the same website and include maps and information which are constantly updated.

4 - Evaluate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda in Brazil, particularly regarding the targets and indicators of SDG 6: “By 2030, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all”, which is essential for the achievement of other SDGs, such as SDG 5, SDG 13 and SDG 11. The IAS is the focal point for the preparation of the SDG 6 chapter in the “Spotlight Report” of the Civil Society Working Group for the 2030 Agenda, dedicated to annually tracking advances and setbacks in relation to all SDGs in Brazil, focusing on the defense of rights, fight against inequality, and respect for the planet.","It aims to foster inclusion and prioritization of traditionally marginalized and vulnerable groups, such as urban populations living in precarious conditions, rural populations, indigenous peoples, and communities that occupy traditional territories, among others, through the goal of universal access to water and sanitation. To reinforce the 2033 targets for universal access to water and sanitation established by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG), particularly SDG 6. To raise awareness of the critical role of SDG 6 in the 2030 Agenda, as a goal that is transversal to other SDGs, especially SDG 5 and SDG 13. To mobilize society to demand accountability from the various levels of government in relation to the progress and actions required for the achievement of Brazil´s 2033 target. To promote World Toilet Day Brazil (WTDB) as a landmark to raise awareness of the human right to water and sanitation, foster technical debates, and give visibility to existing solutions. In addition, the annual edition of the WTDB is a date for accountability and evaluation of actions required to reach universal access to water and sanitation by 2033.","Associação Bem-Te-Vi Diversidade

The Foundation combines its programmes with advocacy in Nigeria and around the world to provide robust support for its primary stakeholders from birth to age. The Foundation is working to reduce the mortality rate of neonates in NICU and ultimately achieve SDG 3 which is
ensuring healthy lives and promoting well-being for all at all ages, and most specifically, SDG target 3.2 which focuses on ending preventable deaths of newborns
and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality and under-mortality. WBFA is also strongly aligned and committed to SDG6, ensuring access to water and sanitation for all. A key objective of WBFA is Increasing the accessibility of sustainable maternal, newborn, infant, child and adolescent continuum of care through a lifetime of healthy habits from reproductive health education and family planning, and to improved water sanitation and handwashing (WASH) behaviours.
The WBFA’s flagship program, the Mamacare Antenatal and Postnatal Education  Programme aim to reduce Nigeria’s staggering burden of maternal and child  mortality and morbidity. The program has encouraged skilled and equipped health  facility deliveries guided by the WHO and partners-supported ""Network for Improving  Quality of Care for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health,""  The MamaCare Antenatal Education classes are led by a qualified midwife  and are held weekly. The sessions give pregnant women practical information,  advice, and support to help prepare for birth and care for their newborns. The Mamacare program is  currently running in 7 states within Nigeria (Kwara ,Lagos, Abuja, Osun, Cross River, Sokoto and Kano) To date, the program has reached 570 hospitals, both public and private in six States  and the Federal Capital Territory of Abuja servicing over 230,000 women.
To this end, as an extension to the Mamacare programme, WBFA in 2015 launched an impactful WASH campaigns using the TEACH  CLEAN training package, which is in line with WHO and UNICEF recommendations  on safe environmental cleaning. The WBFA’s MamaCare Clinic midwives have since  taken up the mantle of improved WASH standards for their antenatal and postnatal  classes, and advocate strongly to the staff at the healthcare facilities at which they  give their classes. 
In 2018, WBFA launched its Adolescent Skills and Drills Personal, Social, and Health Education programme that positively impacted on the health and wellbeing of the adolescent. The project further strengthened the rights of the girl child which was actualized through advocacy and education of the target populations. 
In 2022, WBFA scaled up its WASH interventions WBFA was a partnership with Reckitt- Dettol Nigeria, to implement Hygiene Quest program across three States in Nigeria, namely FCT Abuja, Lagos and Kwara States. Reckitt’s vision is to reach 6 million children in Nigeria by 2025 and the partnership is aimed educating and aiding behavior change in children's Water, Sanitation and hygiene habits thus reducing in Nigeria.","The intended impact WBFA's WASH programs and advocacy is 
1. Strengthening national and subnational WASH sector advocacy, systems and policy and their linkages to other sectors.
2. Increasing equitable, universal access to and use of sustainable WASH services and education.
3. Strengthened gender equality,  participation social inclusion in WASH within healthcare facilities, households, communities and institutions.
4. The growth in dedicated knowledge, programs and learning processes in order to strengthen use of new evidence, innovation and practices in sustainable and inclusive WASH access, practices and behavioural.
Through the WBFA X Dettol Hygiene Quest program collaboration we aim to contribute and accelerate Hygiene Quest’s project target to educate, empower and inspire 6 million school children to practice healthy hygiene habits in Nigeria, to achieve a 20% increase in hand washing incidence, reduce diarrhea cases by 10% and achieve a
10% decline in absenteeism by 2025. 
Consequently, reducing the incidence of illness and sick days from school, will have a profound, generational, impact on health, education, and development. Therefore, the WBFA X Reckitt - Dettol collaboration will go beyond implementing the Hygiene Quest curriculum in School as it will be leveraging on the existing WBFA structure to reach a high population across the three states in Nigeria targeting communities, and healthcare facilities with a proposed expansion to a further 3 states. The program aims at bringing timely health education and behavior change interventions to a total of 41,200 individuals in its first phase. The breakdown of this phase 1 target includes 9,200 students, 25,000 mothers and 7,000 community members in schools, health care facilities and communities within the three states (Kwara, Lagos, Abuja respectively) 
Achieving Sustainable Development Goal 6 by 2030 requires extraordinary efforts and the WBFA through its programs and partnerships is committed to advocating for the provision of equitable access to water, sanitation and hygiene services, strengthening tailored community approaches to WASH and working with national and subnational bodies’ as well as multilateral NGO and organisations to develop and implement equitable WASH programs, policies and strategies.","Reckitt

In the region, several border agreements refer to transboundary waters, mainly as border monuments. The Transboundary Water Assessment Programme (TWAP) estimated that the most critical challenge for the region in terms of Transboundary Water Resources Management (TWRM) is governance due to the absence of specific agreements for their management.
In response to the above and the requests of the countries, the Central American Commission on Environment and Development (CCAD) included transboundary water management as part of the Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) guideline established in the Regional Environmental Framework Strategy (ERAM). Furthermore, since 2019, the CCAD, together with Global Water Partnership Central America, initiated a process called REGIONAL MULTI-STAKEHOLDER DIALOGUE (RMSD) to foster cooperation between countries in the management of transboundary waters, leading to actions at the basin level, and based on the opportunities and benefits identified by the participants, in addition to the establishment of communities of practice.
Representatives from the Ministries of Environment and Ministries of Foreign Affairs from the Central American Integration System (SICA) and related stakeholders are part of the RMSD; as well as partners such as the Secretariat of the Water Convention of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), and the IW: LEARN program of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). The RMSD, is organized around annual face-to-face and virtual meetings that have contributed to the establishment of a community of practice.
Through the RMSD, countries have recognized the importance of TWRM in the region and expressed the need to prepare Regional Guidelines that identify common objectives to guide the establishment of agreements that strengthen cooperation in this area. These results were collected in the ERAM 2021-2025 of the CCAD, approved on February 10, 2021, which defines within its third strategic line the Integrated Management of Water Resources (IWRM) and, as a result: ""Constituted and operating a regional framework for the management of International Waters, Basins and Transboundary Aquifers"", and as a strategic action 3.4.1 ""The elaboration and proposal for adoption of the Regional Guidelines for Cooperation in International Waters,  with the participation of priority political and institutional entities"".
GWP Central America commits to continue providing technical and logistic support to CCAD in the organization of the RMSD, as well as in establishing communities of practice and the agreements that result from the process, including the elaboration and approval of the Regional Guidelines on the Principles of Cooperation for TWRM in the SICA Region. Also, to contribute to generate information and strengthening capacities in International Water Law and other related issues.","This process is part of the commitments made by the countries of the SICA region within the framework of the 2030 Agenda, specifically target 6.5. and its indicators 6.5.1. and 6.5.2. related to the level of implementation of IWRM and the area of transboundary basins covered with cooperation arrangements. According to the results of the evaluation carried out by the region's countries in 2020, the management of transboundary basins and aquifers is one of the main gaps to advance in the implementation of IWRM. This is reflected in the average score of 6.5.2 indicator: 3.64%.
The promotion of the RMSD process, as well as the adoption of agreements and the establishment of spaces for the exchange of information, directly impacts regional stability, the ecological and socioeconomic sustainability of the areas of the transboundary basins, institutional capacities and available information, improving the quality of life of the population","- SICA: Central American Integration System

This would have a direct impact on livelihoods, mainly on subsistence, as well as on the achievement of the 2030 Agenda, since climate change is a transversal element that conditions the fulfillment of the Objectives.
Although discouraging, this panorama confirms the need to carry out assertive actions to mitigate and adapt to current and future climate challenges. If the same trend of current emissions is maintained, the projected impacts by 2040 will be inevitable, causing extreme weather phenomena in all regions of the world.
This scenario, which sounds inevitable, indicates a race against time to define technical and political solutions that adapt to the conditions of each country, based on a sustainable development that involves the full participation of multiple actors in the territory, mainly those sectors who have been historically marginalized.
This new model for development will require important paradigm shifts in relation to the planning and implementation of adaptation measures in the different economic and social sectors, going from fragmented traditional approaches to comprehensive solutions with a joint management approach for disaster risk mitigation.
Within the current approaches, models based on ecosystems are gaining strength, which integrate the sustainable management of natural resources, as well as the integrated management of water resources as adaptation strategies to the effects of climate change, directly contributing to a more effective use of available financing, considering the cost of action versus inaction, and the investment required for mitigation of impacts versus adaptation, mainly in developing countries.
In this context, 30 Latin American countries have linked Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) as a fundamental element for adaptation and risk management within their climate commitments. This is particularly important for Central America, where according to the Germanwatch Global Climate Risk Index (2018), four of the countries in the region are among the fifteen with the highest climate risk globally.
IWRM has been important in advancing agreement and coordination between different sectors and actors, positioning itself as a planning and action approach that allows countries to improve their capacities to face the impacts of climate change - considering that most of these are manifested through water - and contribute to a development that is resilient to the effects of climate change.
The opportunity that IWRM represents to contribute to climate action has allowed GWP to assist institutions and focal points at the national level in the processes of preparing projects and water initiatives that will allow the implementation of climate action instruments, through the strengthening of capacities, the formulation of management strategies and the design of proposals for the leverage of financial resources","The increasing linkage of Integrated Water Resources Management in climate instruments such as Nationally Determined Contributions and National Adaptation Plans, strengthens the development of articulated proposals that maximize the potential for access to financing necessary for climate risk mitigation and sustainable water resource management.
Supporting countries in the analysis of their regulatory framework, that is, policies in their different forms of regulatory expression: laws, plans, programs, climate change and water projects at the national level, is one of the actions included in GWP Water and Climate Strategy. These instruments consider gender mainstreaming that facilitates the participation of women in climate action and public policies, so that they have greater capacities to participate, be included and lead decision-making processes related to climate change and resource management.
Programmatic support allows countries to determine actions to identify and address the main economic, political, ecological, and cultural causes that generate vulnerability, with special attention to extreme hydrometeorological events such as droughts and floods. Through GWP's technical assistance, countries will be supported to generate project initiatives framed within these prioritized actions, while strengthening institutional capacities at the national level.
Water projects and initiatives for climate resilience involve a high degree of intersectorality, under a holistic approach that considers the integration of the needs and the fulfillment of the 2030 Agenda objectives, including poverty eradication, food security, energy, among others.","- Central American Commission for Environment and Development (CCAD)

Objectif spécifique : De façon spécifique, il s’agira de: o Informer et sensibiliser les populations rurales de 2 villages du département de Lakota sur l’importance de la gestion intégrée des ressources en eau ; o Mettre en place les infrastructures hydroélectriques améliorer d’accès à l’eau potable à disposition des aux groupements villageois féminins en vue de l’allègement les corvées d’eau ; o Permettre à plus de 2000 femmes rurales de savoir lire, écrire et calculer et gérer les revenus issus de la vente d’eau potable ; o permettre à plus de 2000 femmes rurales de mieux se prendre en charge en vue de l’amélioration des conditions de vie de leur famille.Activité 1 : Missions d’information- sensibilisation sur la gestion communautaire de l’eau potable et la scolarisation des filles et l’alphabétisation des femmes ; Activité 2 : Séances d’alphabétisation fonctionnelle d’Appui des groupements villageois féminins à la mise en œuvre et de gestion issus des activités génératrices de revenues Activités 3 : construction des Centres d’apprentissage Activités 4 : Appui des groupements villageois féminins à la mise en œuvre et à la gestion des activités génératrices de revenus Activité 5 : Construction de garderies pour recueillir les enfants des apprenantes Activité 6 : Construction de forages et d’un château d’eau et de pompes hydroélectriques fonctionnant avec l’énergie solaire Activités 7 : amélioration de la gestion de l’eau et des revenus issus d’activités génératriceDans cette région du projet, l’eau n'est pas distribuée dans les maisons, ni même dans tous les quartiers et dans les villages, ce sont les femmes qui sont chargées d'aller chercher l'eau. Elles parcourent des kilomètres à la recherche de l’eau de consommation dans les marigots le plus souvent avec leur enfant sur le dos, les villages ne disposent pas de garderies d’enfants. Elles y sont accoutumées dès l'enfance. Les conséquences en sont importantes : longues heures consacrées à cette quête, qui ne laisse pas de temps pour d'autres activités valorisantes (formation, activité lucrative, éducation des enfants.) et pénalise les fillettes souvent empêchées de continuer d'aller à l'école pour aider leurs mères. Par ailleurs, pour les femmes et a fortiori pour les fillettes, la lourde charge des récipients d'eau régulièrement portée sur la tête n'est pas neutre pour la santé, comportant des risques de détérioration des vertèbres. L’alphabétisation des femmes rurales étayée par un programme d'enseignement dans les domaines de la nutrition, la santé, de l'hygiène, de la gestion domestique des ressources en eau. Aussi, le projet devra aider à créer des groupements d’intérêts économiques autour d'AGR pour plus d’implication des hommes dans la gestion de l’eau. Il permettra la valorisation des groupements existent dont presque tous leurs membres ne savent ni écrire eux-mêmes leurs demandes de crédit, ni suivre et contrôler dans la transparence la distribution et le remboursement des crédits octroyés. P","Dans nos sociétés africaines, la gestion de l’eau et des tâches ménagères incombent aux femmes par transmission de connaissances et de rôles de génération en génération. Les femmes gèrent la nutrition, les soins de santé et d'hygiène de la famille, elles savent estimer les besoins d'eau potable des familles et collectivités, elles identifient mieux les risques de l'eau polluée, elles connaissent les lieux propices à la collecte d'eau saine, elles ont la compétence pour détecter les changements dans la qualité et la quantité de approvisionnement, elles ont développé une capacité d'adaptation au changement reposant sur leurs connaissances concrètes en gestion de la ressource. Une femme qui n'est pas capable d'offrir de l'eau potable à un invité ou à un membre de la famille sera renvoyée chez ses parents, car responsable de manque d'eau dans la maison, c'est une honte pour le mari vis à vis des invités...aujourd'hui le savoir-faire des femmes en Afrique ou ailleurs en matière de gestion de l'eau saine et potable ainsi qu'en assainissement n'est pas reconnu, parce qu'elles sont illettrées ou analphabètes et n'ont pas droit à la parole. Elles ont du mal à laisser des traces d’écrits pour préserver ces savoirs traditionnels et ancestraux qui se perdent de plus en plus partout dans le monde. Bien que 70% des pauvres vivent en zone rurale et que l’accès à l’eau, l’éducation et la santé soit des droits fondamentaux et des conditions essentielles pour réduire la pauvreté, améliorer les conditions de vie des populations et assurer la sécurité alimentaire, de nombreuses études révèlent que la population rurale, particulièrement les femmes, est restée en marge du progrès social, de l’autonomisation des programmes d’éducation et de santé dans les zones rurales. La répartition des tâches domestiques non renommés demeure donc dans la grande partie l’affaire des femmes car depuis leur bas âge elles sont éduquer pour être des mères et épouses et sont délègues aux travaux domestique. Le problème majeur d’accès à l’eau potable, de l’accès à l’éducation et la santé est difficile pour les femmes rurales à cause des effets néfastes de la tradition Aussi, le présent projet d’accès à l’eau potable et d’alphabétisation fonctionnelle basé en vue d’une meilleure autonomisation voudrait développer des activités comme : information-sensibilisation des populations sur l’importance de l’implication de toutes les couches sociales femmes hommes jeunes à la gestion intégrée des ressources en eau et de l’importance de la scolarisation des jeunes filles, formation d’alphabétisation. Ce projet permettra d’allégé de façon significatives les tâches de corvées d’eau des femmes, d’impliquer mieux les hommes dans la gestion de l’eau et de renforcer les capacités des femmes en comptabilité simplifié, à la vie associative et à l’alphabétisation en vue d’une meilleure gestion des revenues issues de la vente de l’eau potable.

Most recently, our tools were developed into the first global sustainability standard for hydropower. Our Standard was officially launched in September 2021. It is governed by a multi-stakeholder Council made up of representatives of social, community and environmental organisations, governments, commercial and development banks and the hydropower sector. This inclusive approach to governance ensures that all stakeholder voices are heard in the shaping of the use of the tools. It is linked to the issuance of green bonds by the Climate Bonds Initiative and the certification of renewable energy provision through RE 100 group. 
The Hydropower Sustainability (HS) Certification Scheme is the driving mechanism to make sustainable water-infrastructure management, especially for hydropower, the norm. The scheme incentives and recognises hydropower projects for their environmental, social and governance (ESG) performance, helping to set minimum performance expectations for the sector and publicly acknowledging and rewarding projects for meeting these expectations. It considers transboundary issues, Indigenous Peoples rights, biodiversity challenges and integrated water resource management. 
Using a rating system, the Standard certifies high-performing hydropower projects at any stage of preparation, development and operation worldwide, and supports developers and operators to benchmark against internationally recognised levels of good and best practices. 
Over the last ten years, our team has focused on building capacity where needed the most through numerous donor-funded capacity-building programmes. Examples include collaborations with the World Bank in the Zambezi Basin and Nepal; the Swiss State Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) in Ghana, Indonesia, Colombia, Albania and the Western Balkans, Tajikistan and Central Asia; Agence française de développement (AFD) and African Development Bank (AfDB) in Francophone African countries; and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) in Myanmar, Nepal and Mozambique.","Hydropower projects and other water-related infrastructure provide an interface between society and environment. They can protect humans from natural hazards, such as droughts or floods. They also allow people to benefit from what nature offers – renewable and clean electricity that drives socio-economic development and enables wind and solar power with storage services. But such projects inevitably influence the environment, by either harming or improving existing conditions. 
This is a global challenge and is widely covered in the SDGs, most notably in SDGs 6, 7 and 13. Today, there is a huge opportunity to improve existing infrastructure and help develop new climate-aligned projects, but ESG concerns are affecting current production and new developments. Governments in developing countries have highlighted the need for support to improve hydropower practices, especially due to the rising challenges caused by climate change in their countries. 
Many developing countries have constraints, particularly related to institutional capacity on ESG issues, that limit the potential for hydropower assets to deliver sustainable benefits locally and regionally. The limited scope of local training provision, the lack of a structured framework to guide project development, and insufficient awareness of good practice are some examples of these constraints.  
Through application of the Hydropower Sustainability Standard and by increasing the number of certified hydropower projects, more sustainable water-related infrastructure, most notably hydropower projects, will be planned and developed thanks to strengthened institutional capacity, and opportunities will be increased for climate finance investments in developing countries.",,"Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 13","6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 7.1 , 7.2, 7.3, 7.a, 7.b, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3",,,"Link to a published assessment of a certified project: https://www.hydrosustainability.org/published-assessments/sebzor

On one hand, rivers support the development of cities with a wide range of ecosystem services including sustenance and livelihood. On the other hand, cities support rivers through their good practices in order to help them preserve their natural character and continue to offer their various ecosystem services. However, in the last few decades, while rivers have fulfilled their role in this symbiotic relationship, cities have largely failed to adhere to their commitments. 
The Government of India is working extensively to rejuvenate the twenty river basins in the country. In 2014-15, the Namami Gange Mission was launched as a Flagship Initiative for the protection, conservation and rejuvenation of the Ganga River Basin. Guided by a holistic river basin centric approach, the focus is on the riverine ecosystem, including components such as pollution abatement, solid and liquid waste management, biodiversity, afforestation, wetland conservation, groundwater management, etc. Namami Gange Mission has identified five strategic areas of intervention - Nirmal Ganga (Unpolluted Flow), Aviral Ganga (Unrestricted Flow), Jan Ganga (People River Connect), Gyan Ganga (Research and Knowledge) and Arth Ganga (Boosting Economy and Livelihood). The National Mission for Clean Ganga (NMCG) is the implementing agency of the Namami Gange Mission.
Namami Gange Mission recognizes that integrated river basin management needs to be interwoven with economic growth and urban transformations. Efforts are being made to engage city governments in this collective responsibility of river rejuvenation and economical gains with the stretch of river flowing through or near their boundaries.  This is in alignment with the Hon’ble Prime Minister of India’s clarion call for “need for new thinking for river cities. Cities should be responsible for rejuvenating their rivers. It has to be done not just with the regulatory mind set but also with developmental and faciliatory outlook.”
Subsequently, on 25th November 2021, the River Cities Alliance (RCA) was launched as a dedicated platform for river cities in India to ideate, discuss and exchange information for sustainable management of urban rivers. NMCG, National Institute of Urban Affairs (NIUA) and key partners provide dedicated technical and handholding support to the 107 member cities* of the RCA, as they implement interventions for river-sensitive development.
The Governance Mechanism of the RCA has been envisaged as a city-led movement for promulgating river-sensitive planning and development. Hence, the agenda and operations for RCA are determined by the member cities. The activities being undertaken are in three broad areas:
A. Networking: Organizing annual river summit; facilitating exchange of official visits for member cities; and publishing a bi-monthly newsletter
B. Capacity Building: Conducting certification training programmes for officials of member cities; annual calendar of events; and organizing webinars and expert talk.
C. Technical Support: River-sensitive urban planning and interventions; Innovations in urban river management; river linked economy and rejuvenation of urban water bodies","RCA catalyzed the development of NMCG’s ‘New Urban Agenda’, where river cities own& implement river-sensitive development& economic rejuvenation, through shared learning, while at same time inspire others to take up progressive action.
Central to the ‘New Urban Agenda’, is the development of Urban River Management Plans (URMPs) for river cities. URMP comprises of 3 key elements – Environmental (River to support a habitat for biodiversity to thrive), Economic (River to provide opportunities for economic development) and Social (River to be celebrated among citizens). Together, three elements propose 10 River Development Goals(RDG) which help river cities systematically& holistically plan interventions required to revive& maintain rivers in a sustainable manner. The 10 RDGs are:
•	To ensure effective regulation of activities in floodplain
•	To keep the river free from pollution
•	To rejuvenate waterbodies and wetlands in the city
•	To enhance the riparian buffer along riverbanks
•	To adopt increased reuse of treated wastewater
•	To ensure maximum good quality return flow from the city into the river
•	To develop ecofriendly riverfront projects
•	To leverage on the economic potential of the river
•	To inculcate river-sensitive behavior among citizens
•	To engage citizens in river management activities
Moving forward, RCA strives to onboard more national& international cities to provide an international platform to promulgate knowledge exchange, peer learning& partnership. Efforts will be made to create an inclusive environment with stakeholders from different domains– civil society organizations, academicians, policymakers, urban planners, private sector, technology providers, etc. 
RCA, through development of URMPs, expects to encourage member cities to undertake progressive action for urban river management in their cities. This will support member cities in accelerating implementation of following SDGs &realization of overarching commitments of nation states.
oSDG6:Clean Water and Sanitation – Key component of the peer learning initiative is its focus on pollution abatement of rivers, restoration of riverine ecosystem, adoption of circular water economy approach& building capacity initiatives of city governments& concerned stakeholder. Under RCA, several niche online certification programmes have been launched.
oSDG11:Primary objective of RCA is to support member cities in sustainable management of urban rivers, in order to build river sensitive cities of future.  RCA was launched with the vision of developing river sensitive cities for the future. The city of Kanpur in Uttar Pradesh became the first Indian city to develop its own unique URMP 
oSDG14:Sustainable adoption of URMP component will enable cities to ensure sustenance of life. For instance, efforts of Namami Gange Mission have led to significant improvement of biodiversity sightings such as Dolphins, Hilsa, etc.
oSDG15:Key component of the river sensitive cities is to rebuild green cover. This directly supports restoration of riverine ecosystem& life on land. In Ganga Basin, over 30,000Ha has been afforested under the Mission
oSDG17: Central to RCA is partnership with local, national& international organizations& stakeholders. NMCG is actively collaborating with countries such as Israel, Germany, Denmark, Netherlands, etc. At present, RCA has 1international member city – Aarhus, Denmark and efforts are underway to involve more international cities.","National Mission for Clean Ganga, World Bank, Japan International Cooperation Agency, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ), Asian Development Bank, Netherlands Embassy, Royal Norwegian Embassy, Embassy of Israel and Embassy Of The Federal Republic Of Germany","Goal 6, Goal 11, Goal 14, Goal 15, Goal 17",,"Sat, 04/01/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 03/31/2026 - 12:00",https://niua.in/rca/,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3846153846153861

            Promoting Zero Based Natural Farming initiatives in Ganga Basin States in collaboration with relevant stakeholders and ministries .",Ganga Basin States and other River Basin Organisations or Authorities,"Denmark, Germany, India, Israel, Netherlands",Global,"Due to increased population growth, urbanization, and economic development, the global demand for water is increasing over the years. In India, surface water and ground water are the major sources of water used for residential, agricultural, commercial, industrial, and various other purposes. Among surface water, the role of rivers and other water bodies such as lakes, ponds, springs, rivulets etc. is of extreme importance while bridging the water demand and supply. 
Over the years, the growing pressure of water demand on rivers and other water bodies has resulted in deterioration of our river water quality like for River Ganges. The situation is expected to become critical with additional impact of increased climate change. Hence considering the urgency of the situation, the Government of India established  NMCG to implement the Namami Gange Mission launched in 2015. This is an integrated mission which operates in conjunction with various departments and ministries for protection, conservation, and rejuvenation of River Ganga. Guided by basin centric holistic approach, the focus has been on the riverine ecosystem, including components such as pollution abatement, solid and liquid waste management, biodiversity, afforestation, wetland conservation, agribusiness, groundwater management, etc.
With the concerted efforts in area of river rejuvenation, the NMCG has been focusing on the importance of adopting the technology driven nature-based solutions. As part of mission, the objective of adopting the technology driven nature-based solution is to focus on conserving, protecting, and rejuvenating the entire riverine ecosystem. Some of the nature-based solutions to be included in the mission as part of the commitment includes
1)Wetland Restoration and Management- Wetlands are considered important for wastewater treatment because of the ability of many wetland plants to absorb large amounts of nutrients and toxic substances. Apart from that, wetlands support in carbon sequestration which helps mitigating the climate change impact and global warming.
2)	Rainwater Harvesting (Catch the Rain- Where it falls When it falls)-
Considering the importance of rainwater harvesting & water conservation, government launched “Catch the Rain” campaign “Catch the rain, where it falls, when it falls” to nudge all stakeholders to create RWH Structure suitable to the climatic conditions and sub-soil strata, with people’s active participation.  Campaign started in 2019 and continued in phased manner till 2022. Campaign's focus is on rainwater harvesting and water conservation, enumerating, geo-tagging & making inventory of all water bodies; preparation of scientific plans for water conservation, setting up Water Utility Centres in all districts, intensive afforestation, and awareness generation. The campaign shall be continued in coming years and can be replicated in Indian cities and other countries.
3)Zero-budget Natural Farming- It includes chemical-free farming to be promoted along the length of the river for pollution free river and doubling farmer’s income” . This can be implemented in partner countries.
4)Treatment of Sludge using Green Solutions- The treatment of sludge requires green solutions focusing on sustainability & cost-effectiveness.
5)Treatment of Grey and Black Water using Green Solution-The treatment of sludge requires green solutions focusing on sustainability & cost-effectiveness.","The nature-based solutions mentioned above will accelerate the implementation of SDG 6 i.e., Clean Water and Sanitation. The technology driven nature-based solutions such as grey and black water management, management of sludge, adoption of wetland restoration and management, rainwater harvesting and zero budget natural farming will help in keeping rivers pollution free and maintaining the environmental flow of the rivers. The successful implementation of the initiatives will ensure and enable the sustainable management of water for all. 
Along with achieving the targets under SDG 6, the actions/approaches mentioned under the commitment will ensure achieving other SDG’s such as SDG 13: Climate Action wherein efforts will support in combating the climate change and its impacts in Ganga River Basin. Additionally, with restoration and management of wetlands the objective of biodiversity conservation shall enable achieving the SDG 14: Life below Water and SDG 15: Life on Land.  
Also, SDG 17:  Partnership with other collaborations will be achieved as actions and partners are globally accepted. NMCG is actively undertaking international cooperation with countries such as EU, Israel, Japan, Germany, Denmark, and Netherlands. In this regards, the aim of such cooperation’s is to develop partnerships which foster the sustainable development by exchange of science, technology, best practices, policies, and various other learnings across the countries.","1) National Mission for Clean Ganga, Ministry of Jal Shakti, Government of India

The commitment focuses on social protection, access to health, occupational safety, fair contracts, recognition of worker groups and federations, and opportunities to grow within the profession as well as the option to choose alternate careers for themselves and their families. With a focus on informal sanitation workers, our commitment seeks to enable them to voice their challenges and ensure they have the agency to improve their lives and livelihoods. Sector cooperation and strategic partnerships are vital to enable various governments, authorities, organisations, businesses, unions, and other key players to work collaboratively towards improving the working conditions of sanitation workers, a key step towards retaining and expanding the sanitation workforce and delivering on the promise of safely managed sanitation services and decent work for all as set out in SDGs 6.2 and 8. The following are the main intervention areas and vision for the end of the Water Action Decade: Build evidence: Commit to effective approaches to improve working conditions across all aspects (e.g., legal, policy, regulatory, business models, technologies, behaviour change, funding). By 2030, collectively the partners aim to have significantly improved the evidence around numbers, conditions, challenges, and approaches that have worked for sanitation workers at the global and local levels. Reform policy, legislation, and regulation: Commit to including operational guidelines to acknowledge and professionalise the sanitation workforce along the sanitation service chain. These will include operational guidelines and government and employer budgets for their implementation. By 2030 collectively the partners aim to have improved aspects of policy, legislation, and regulation in at least 10 countries. Facilitate improved workplace conditions, benefits, agency, and recognition: Commit to amplifying the voices of workers, towards protecting their rights and thereby promoting their dignity and respect. Recognising their contributions to public health and raising awareness of the importance of their work. By 2030 collectively the partners aim to have supported workers' groups in amplifying voices, establishing or strengthening platforms, associations, and global champions capable of organising and advocating for improved working conditions in at least 10 countries. Dissemination of leading initiatives and enabling cross-learning: Commit to documenting innovative approaches for sanitation workers from diverse experiences (workers to technical agencies and vice versa), enabling replication and scaling across contexts involving other players (government, funders, private sector). By 2030, collectively the partners will engage regularly to take stock of the initiatives, share appropriate practices, work with local players in respective contexts, and hold at least one global workshop for dissemination.","Sanitation workers provide a crucial public service.

Curtailed rights and entitlements of sanitation workers often adversely impact the quality of services they provide, leaving urban settlements prone to issues of health and climate change. A range of multilateral and bilateral agencies are working across the globe, in close coordination with national and sub-national government agencies to improve the lives and working environment of sanitation workers. By bringing together experts of these agencies into forming working groups, it is expected that ideas will travel fast, and innovations will take root more easily.

Since 2006, GWC has positively reached over 3 million people in 40 countries across Africa, the Americas and Asia with clean water access. Grounded on the Ripple Effect Study, GWC established the women for water platform to mobilize collective action that results in clean water access for every woman and her community. Currently supporting and scaling impact in 26 countries, women for water measurably contributes to economic outcomes. GWC and women for water work with our multi-sector partners to drive collective action and empower women and girls in high-priority communities. Our multi-pronged approach is designed to help communities break down barriers to education, promote clean WASH and create economic opportunities for women and girls. GWC recognizes the significant impact water-related challenges have on communities and ecosystems around the world, where almost 2 billion people lack access to safely managed drinking water services (UN Water, 2022), and 3.6 billion lack access to improved sanitation services (WHO and UNICEF, 2022). Achieving universal access to WASH by 2030 will only be achieved through collective action and strong support for climate-resilient services and economic opportunities for women and girls.","GWC will: 1. Mobilize support for the achievement of universal, safe, and sustainable WASH services in up to 50 countries and 10,000 communities, with focus on women and their communities. 2. Educate national decision makers on the importance of WASH to economic empowerment, public health, food security, climate resilience and advancing human potential. 3.

The initiative seeks to strengthen national and regional groundwater governance frameworks and institutional capacity to improve the aquifer's sustainability and the well-being of communities dependent on it.
The initiative consists of a Strategic Action Plan (SAP) implementation and support to it by several partners. The SAP is endorsed by the countries and has five components. The components include facilitating multi-country cooperation, strengthening governance frameworks, monitoring the aquifer and its dependent ecosystems, focusing on areas of transboundary influence and special concern, and raising awareness and mainstreaming gender considerations. The SAP will be implemented using a range of implementation methodologies, including the creation of a coordination mechanism, development of joint activities, developing legal and regulatory frameworks, improving monitoring and data management systems, developing communication and outreach strategies, and engaging stakeholders.
Regarding the governance of the initiative and follow-up, this will involve the countries' active participation and engagement, with coordination and oversight provided by a steering committee comprising representatives from the countries, relevant international organizations, and other stakeholders.
Overall, this initiative is an important step towards improving transboundary aquifer cooperation in the Balkans area and addressing the challenges facing the Dinaric Karst Aquifer System. By strengthening governance frameworks, promoting effective multi-country cooperation, and developing joint management strategies, the initiative has the potential to improve the aquifer's sustainability, secure freshwater resources, support ecosystem health, and advance sustainable development in the region.
The project is part of a long-term endeavor, building upon the first phase of the DIKTAS initiative, which was implemented by UNDP and UNESCO's IHP from 2010-2015.
The first phase focused on enhancing understanding of the Dinaric Karst Aquifer System and its environmental status and establish cooperation mechanisms among the countries sharing the aquifer, providing crucial information on the Dinaric Karst Aquifer System's status, identifying potential threats to groundwater quality, the need for monitoring and common legal and institutional frameworks for groundwater protection, and highlighting the participating countries' interconnectivities and potential for sustainable economic growth. Through a long-term approach, the second phase of DIKTAS aims to build on these insights, improve sustainable management practices, and promote multi-country cooperation and institutional capacity building for the Dinaric Karst Aquifer System and its ecological resources.","This project has the potential to significantly influence transboundary aquifer cooperation in the Balkans area by improving benefits for the beneficiary countries based on the sustainable management of the Dinaric Karst Aquifer System and its ecological resources. This, in turn, can accelerate SDG implementation, including addressing interlinkages.
By establishing effective multi-country cooperation, building trust, and improving communication and collaboration among the countries, the project can promote more effective decision-making, better use of resources, and ultimately, more sustainable outcomes. This can lead to the development of joint management strategies that address potential conflicts and promote sustainable development, especially tailored to the areas of transboundary influence and special concern.
The strengthening of governance frameworks can promote transparency, accountability, and participation, leading to better decision-making and more effective implementation of policies and programs. This can ultimately help to secure freshwater resources for domestic supply, support ecosystem health, and advance sustainable development in the region.
By monitoring the aquifer and its dependent ecosystems, the project can inform decision-making, identify potential risks, and guide the development of management strategies. This can promote the sustainable use of the aquifer and its resources, including its water quality and quantity.
The project's focus on awareness-raising and mainstreaming gender considerations can ensure that women's voices and perspectives are included in decision-making, leading to more inclusive and equitable outcomes. This can help to address the interlinkages between SDGs, including those related to gender equality and the sustainable use of natural resources.","GEF: Global Environment Facility - UNDP: United Nations Development Programme - UNESCO IHP: United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization - International Hydrological Programme - IGRAC: International Groundwater Resources Assessment Centre - GWP: Global Water Partnership","Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 8, Goal 15, Goal 16","6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.b",,,,0.625,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.125,0.0,0.2197802197802206

The programme will contribute to better health, nutrition and education, especially for poorer households and communities, and for women and girls in particular. The programme’s focus on systems marks a fundamental shift in FCDO’s approach to WASH. We had previously focused on projects that aimed to increase first-time access to basic WASH services. Our new approach will enhance the sustainability of WASH services; it will ensure that women are empowered to take informed decisions about the services they receive; and it will attract new public and private finance to accelerate progress towards SDG 6 WASH targets – including universal access to safely managed WASH services. Up to five priority countries will be selected from a group of fifteen. This includes eleven designated flagships that form the core of the UK’s approach to ending the preventable deaths of mothers, young children and infants (EPD) and four countries where investment in WASH systems will complement other UK programmes increasing our impact. Intervention countries will be prioritised considering the national context – taking into account levels of fragility and conflict (reflecting that systems strengthening is more challenging in these situations and the approach would need to be adapted), political willingness to drive a process of reform, and comprehensive needs assessments. The selection process is critical to ensure maximum impact and value for money and will last up to 12 months. Implementation will be programmed over the following four years, ensuring there is sufficient time to embed change. The programme’s influence extends well beyond five priority countries. It is designed to help the WASH sector shift from infrastructure delivery with limited reliability to reinforcing the core systems needed to establish inclusive, sustainable and resilient services. This will be achieved by ensuring lessons learnt are captured and widely communicated, and by establishing a global WASH systems support hub which responds to demand from governments for advice and support on WASH systems strengthening.","This new and additional action will help strength the core systems used by governments to establish and sustain WASH services; services which are inclusive, sustainable and resilient to the impacts of climate change - benefiting people's health, wellbeing and future resilience. Beyond supporting SDG 6 targets 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3, the action will also contribute to universal health coverage, with a focus on prevention that extends to improving access to WASH in health care facilities and schools, and quality education received in particular by girls.

This approach ensures a rich learning experience and offers a broader insight into the different aspects of water challenges. The online platform that is used to offer the SDG toolkit will also be used for global knowledge sharing. By selecting the initiatives that are successful and offering tools to implement these in your own region, we can enlarge the impact of successful initiatives. This is where the Wavemakers United Academy and 1MAP initiative enable a platform where local communities are connected on a global stage. Once sufficient funding is available, our tools can be made available to those not proficient with the English language, those without an internet connection and those without access to a school or local community. Youth is essential within social and technical innovation processes. Joining this commitment means understanding the need of a well-informed next generation that will be able to tackle global water challenges. Three types of partners are essential: (1) coordinating partners, offering staff or tools that help (operationally) facilitate this commitment, (2) funding partners, that support this commitment through financial contributions, and (3) supporting partners, offering their network and/or volunteers to enlarge the impact of this commitment. Coordinating and funding partners (will) engage in a binding agreement with the Wavemakers United Foundation to ensure continuity of coordination of this water action agenda commitment. Supporting partners create a non-binding agreement that will be supportive of all partners within this commitment.","Expected impact of this commitment will be three-fold. First, access to quality education on sustainability topics will be increased around the world in both developed and underdeveloped regions. The toolkit is online accessible and user-friendly, including teachers guides and printable education materials. With this network we will focus on further improving the accessibility of the toolkit, e.g., by offering multiple languages. By organizing these guest-lectures through a multi-disciplinary network of youth organizations, knowledge institutions, private sector, and other organizations we offer youth perspective on their future possibilities. Second, the positive mindset and interactive nature of our program will enthuse the next generation to change their behavior and/or decide to further develop their passion for water. This will then contribute to a more sustainable way of living, and more interest into higher education or career opportunities in the fields of sustainable development. A more skilled labor force is much needed to address the challenges the world is currently facing regarding the climate transition. A broader focus on sustainable development will lead to successful innovations and behavioral changes of individuals, businesses, and governments. Third, through our focus on global knowledge sharing, the impact we make through quality education, behavioral change, and successful innovations on one side of the world can be replicated on the other side of the world. Our platforms lower barriers for global knowledge sharing, ensuring that good practices are easily implementable on more regions than previously possible. This creates business opportunities, global partnerships for sustainable development, and a platform through which youth can build their network.","The Dutch Ministry of Infrastructure and Water Management, The Netherlands IHE Delft Institute for Water Education, The Netherlands University of Balamand (1MAP initiative), Lebanon World Youth Parliament for Water United International Federation of Youth for Water and Climate (UN1FY) Young Experts Program (YEP), The Netherlands Unie van Waterschappen, The Netherlands Stellenbosch University, South Africa South African Parliament for Water, South Africa Make Day, The Netherlands Water Authority AGV, The Netherlands World Merit South Africa International Association of Students in Agricultural and Related Sciences (IAAS), Global Wageningen University & Research, The Netherlands VEI, The Netherlands World Waternet, Global De Jonge Klimaatbeweging, The Netherlands Wable, Kenya/The Netherlands Central Asia Youth for Water, Asia South African Department of Water and Sanitation, South Africa","Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 4, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 8, Goal 9, Goal 10, Goal 11, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 14, Goal 15, Goal 16, Goal 17","1.4, 1.5, 2.3, 2.4 , 2.a, 3.9, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 , 4.4 , 4.5, 4.6, 4.7, 5.a, 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 7.1 , 7.a, 7.b, 8.2 , 8.5, 8.6, 9.1, 9.5, 10.b, 11.6, 11.a, 12.2, 12.5, 12.8, 12.a, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.a, 13.b, 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5, 14.6, 14.7, 14.a, 14.b, 14.c, 15.1, 15.a, 16.6, 16.b, 17.6, 17.7, 17.9, 17.16, 17.17, 17.18","Wed, 03/22/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2030 - 12:00",Announcement video: https://youtu.be/OcsjMh4-NqU 1MAP initiative: https://youtu.be/gQTLdAOsvD4,1.0,0.4444444444444444,0.8333333333333333,1.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

In a “first-ever”, leveraging the latest available technologies, the solution will measure, report, and verify outcomes of Water Management, starting in Addis Ababa, a city of 10 million inhabitants, starting in a sub-set of the city, using Digital Twins in a fully digital and transparent manner. This project is a collaboration of the Ethiopian local and federal government, and multiple innovators in the profit and non-profit sectors like Microsoft, Bentley Systems and VEI. The launch is endorsed by the Dutch Government. The SDG6 Water Management initiative has the potential to be rolled out to over nineteen other countries in fifty-five cities, improving the water needs of half a billion people.","Digital twin technology has the potential to significantly enhance water management in Africa, leading to better outcomes for communities in need. By creating a virtual replica of physical assets, such as water distribution systems, digital twins can be used to analyze, monitor, and optimize water usage and distribution in real-time. This, in turn, can lead to more efficient and effective management of water resources, reducing waste and improving water security. Digital twin technology can also help detect and prevent water leaks and other issues, thereby enhancing the access to clean water for communities, which is especially critical in areas with water scarcity. Additionally, digital twin technology can aid in the development of new water infrastructure projects, such as reservoirs, by simulating and assessing these projects in a virtual environment. This approach can provide valuable insights into the potential impact and effectiveness of these projects, reducing the risk of failure and improving outcomes.","Bentley Systems

The principal criteria for river regulation at that time was to ensure flood protection and increase the area of agricultural land, regardless of environmental impacts. With regard to today’s global challenges, the adequacy of these measures is questionable, mainly because such modifications contributed to the isolation of the riverbed and floodplain, which is one of the main causes of the deteriorating ecological condition of rivers and wetlands. Together with the reduction of natural floodplains, this has contributed to the acceleration of water runoff, worsening flood problems and increase of damage in low-lying areas. The adverse consequences of afore mentioned condition also affect the loss of water in the country, which is particularly evident in periods of drought

Within a period of two years, CORALL intends to engage members of our local and international community to achieve the following short-term objectives:
1.	Barbadians, visitors to the Caribbean, and students from abroad -- act with reference to updated educational materials created by CORALL specifically for them, on the topics of: (1) improving water quality by reducing pollution; (2) sustainable management and protection of coastal ecosystems to avoid significant adverse impacts; and, (3) building effective partnerships to enhance the well-being of coral reef ecosystems; and,
2.	Participants in CORALL’s activities and events demonstrate increased understanding of the issues pertaining to water management, the well-being of coral reef ecosystems – and the well-being of people whose lives depend on clean water and healthy coral reefs.
Implementation Methodologies for achieving these objectives include:
1.	Creation and use of new educational materials including educators’ packages for teachers and camp counsellors, updated curricula for university students, and social media posts based on CORALL’s physical restoration and management of coral nurseries, emphasis on the Ridge to Reef approach, development of a Nature Interpretive Area within the Folkestone Marine Reserve; customization of existing materials such as the “People and Corals” package published by the Caribbean Conservation Association; and;
2.	Activities such as fun quizzes, collective creation of artistic works, science-based investigations on biodiversity and threats to reefs; and other activities that demonstrate knowledge, experience and interest in topics pertaining to water management and the well-being of coral reef ecosystems and people. 
Follow-up mechanisms include continued accountability to, and involvement of, CORALL’s members, trustees and sponsors; and, seeking and finding more support to continue the Alliance’s activities. We have learned, for example, that monitoring and evaluating, and subsequently reporting on the lessons learned from our activities, have helped to encourage greater understanding, co-operation, and support.    
This initiative will continue to be governed under the laws of Barbados that pertain to permissions required by the regulatory authorities; accountability with respect to the constitution of the Alliance as a registered charity; and the voluntarism that is essential to the existence and functioning of the Alliance.","CORALL’s new initiatives pertaining to continued community engagement, and sharing of information, will directly accelerate implementation of SDG goals 6, 14 and 17, and indirectly accelerate others -- by actively involving participants, assessing, and demonstrating their level of knowledge and engagement, and gradually involving more members of the community so that they are intrigued and encouraged to participate in management of water and reefs. CORALL’s activities have already proved to have a ripple effect within the local and international communities. 
Since inception of the Alliance in 2016, our membership has grown to more than 400 individuals and organisations … and we expect further growth during the next two years.  Many CORALL members are actively involved in voluntarily scoping for coral nursery locations; populating nurseries with fragments of opportunity; and monitoring, maintaining, and outplanting restoration sites.  Other members practice academic and citizens’ science by checking the reefs for biodiversity and signs of disease. These types of activities will continue during the next two years and beyond. 
The Coral Reef Restoration Alliance (CORALL) also intends to establish a Nature Interpretive Area at Vauxhall Reef, within Folkestone Park and Marine Reserve, Barbados. 
CORALL has received permission in principle from the regulatory authorities of the Government of Barbados who manage the park and reserve. Establishment of the Nature Interpretive Area will be accomplished within two years, given that all necessary permissions are granted.
We have already installed a successful Staghorn Coral Nursery at Vauxhall Reef within the recreational area of the marine reserve. This reef is biodiverse and scenic, and is currently in fair condition. We will scope and identify sites to outplant growing fragments from this coral nursery into the proposed Nature Interpretive Area, after which we will develop a Nature Interpretive Tour for visitors to Folkestone.
Development of the site and tour will entail the installation of signage and creation of educational materials. These signs and educational materials will build awareness and engage members of our local and international community.
In addition to CORALL’s physical restoration activities, and the development of the Nature Interpretive Area and Tour, we will continue to practice our ‘Ridge to Reef’ approach by participating in events and activities that are aimed towards increasing understanding of members of the public, and on building effective partnerships. We will continue to organise events such the Symposium on Coral Reef Ecosystems (2018), and the National Assembly hosted at UN House in Barbados (2019) – and will continue to contribute to events organised by others, such as Arborfest, coastal cleanups, and the Forum to formulate a National Plan for coral restoration.
We have begun to develop an educational program and will broaden that to add more games and activities, sessions, lesson plans and outreach materials.

            By 2025, IOM will reach at least 25 million conflict and disaster-affected people with life-saving WASH services to ensure the human right to drinking water and sanitation for displaced populations and their host communities.","Migrants and displaced persons, diaspora groups, host communities and communities in situation of water stress",Global,Global,"People on the move find themselves at the heart of the water and sanitation crisis, exacerbated by climate change. At the same time, disasters, climate change and environmental degradation are reshaping both patterns of water availability and access and patterns of human mobility. Conflict over water resources or exacerbated by shrinking water resources also impacts these patterns. Access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene, as per the Sustainable Development Goal 6, is among the most basic human needs for health and well-being for migrants and displaced persons. In this context, IOM commits to:
1. Further advance the role that integrated human mobility solutions can play in addressing water-related issues, and the role that integrated water resources management can play for human mobility, as a central element to protect populations’ human rights and promote resilient, cohesive and peaceful societies. This means:
a. Developing solutions for people to make informed decisions to remain in situ when possible and preferred by local communities, through innovative, sustainable, and cooperative water resources management; but also, through adaptation solutions including water-related disaster risk management with preventive measures, anticipatory actions, and early warning systems accessible to all.
b. Developing solutions for people on the move, responding to the impacts of water extremes on migrants and displaced populations, including through WASH assistance while ensuring that sustainable water management is a priority when finding durable solutions to displacement.
c. Developing solutions for people to move, where migration is an adaptation strategy and a response to losses and damages related to water resources, with specific attention to the context of water issues in the rural world, as highlighted by the Dakar Declaration.
2. Promote and work towards ensuring equitable access to environmentally sustainable and climate-resilient WASH infrastructure and services, tailored to local needs and contexts, in line with the 2020-2030 Strategy for Sustainability Management in the United Nations System and the Climate and Environment Charter; including by engaging in relevant thematic policy processes to address the linkages between human mobility and water scarcity, as recommended by the Praia Call for Action; and by empowering local governments to include migrants and displaced persons alongside host communities in decision making on the governance of water-related issues.
3. Empower migrants and mobile populations as development actors and leverage their contributions for innovation on water-use efficiency solutions and integrated water resources management; and enable Member States to implement transformative adaptation to climate change and disaster risk reduction measures linked to integrated water resources management.
4. By 2025, IOM will reach at least 25 million conflict and disaster-affected people with life-saving WASH services to ensure the human right to drinking water and sanitation for displaced populations and their host communities and contribute to the achievement of SDG 6 in crisis and displacement settings.
5. Strengthen through its WASH intervention, the collaboration, coherence and complementarity across humanitarian, development, and peacebuilding actions, within IOM and with its partners, ensuring comprehensive, people-centered approaches supporting progress towards durable solutions.","The Water Action Agenda is an opportunity to mobilize all stakeholders to work towards reducing existential threats linked to water access and achieving universal access to water and sanitation for all, without any discrimination, while prioritizing those most in need, including migrants and displaced persons.

            Tested SODIS technology adapted to the needs of rural health facilities in Malawi",District health facilities and the communities they serve,Malawi,Africa,"Every year, over 17 million women in the poorest countries give birth in healthcare facilities without adequate water and hygiene measures, putting their and their babies’ lives at risk. Over 1 million deaths yearly are associated with inadequate access to safe water during births. In resource-poor settings, basic interventions such as hand washing can lower the risk of neonatal deaths by 44%, but this is only possible if water is available. Without water, the ability of healthcare workers to carry out proper infection prevention and control measures and to demonstrate safe water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) practices to communities, is significantly compromised. This has become even more apparent the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, where access to clean water has been and remains critical to stopping the spread of the virus. The SURG-Water transdisciplinary team are developing a sustainable, low-energy solution to address the problem of inadequate access to water in rural healthcare facilities in Malawi. Our particular focus is on the needs of mothers and newborn babies, as well as the clinicians providing maternal healthcare services. Using solar water disinfection (SODIS) technology to treat harvested rainwater, we aim to provide a backup supply to address interruptions in existing water supplies. We are developing a prototype system adapted to the needs of district healthcare facilities. The planned studies will evaluate the feasibility, effectiveness and adoption of solar water disinfection technology in clinical settings to inform national scale-up.","Water is at the heart of climate action. Sustainable water management helps society adapt to climate change by building resilience, protecting health and saving lives. Capturing and treating rainwater is particularly useful in regions with uneven rainfall distribution to build resilience to shocks and ensure supplies for dry periods. While firstly addressing infrastructure deficiency, the project will directly improve the quality of care, working conditions and the health service experience of people who work and receive care in rural health care facilities of Malawi. By enabling constant access to clean, safe water, the project will improve the Malawi health care system's ability to meet the patient’s needs. SURG-Water will deliver evidence to fill a significant policy gap in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA): innovative solutions to address water shortages in rural health care facilities.

The Water for Women Fund responds to evidence that gendered approaches to WASH can contribute to more effective, sustainable WASH outcomes as well as improvements in women’s and girls’ well-being, health and agency. WASH delivery offers an entry point to facilitate changes in gender relations, norms and attitudes.
Advancing gender equality through implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 6 – Clean Water and Sanitation– will see a world where women and girls do not bear the time burden of walking long distances every day to collect water for their families, where their reproductive health and nutrition status is vastly improved, where fewer babies die as a result of mothers giving birth in unhygienic health care facilities and girls no longer miss school because there are no appropriate menstrual hygiene management services. These are just a few examples which highlight the critical contributions of water and WASH to the health and resilience of women, their families and communities.
The Australian Government extended Water for Women fund for 2.5 years, and committed an additional $36 million in funding, to make Water for Women Fund’s total budget of $154.9 million during 2018-25. This fund will be delivering 100% climate finance eligible programs while maintaining its focus on gender equality and social inclusion in its’ extension phase (2023-25).","Water for Women aims to improve the health, gender equality and wellbeing of Indo-Pacific Communities.

            Numerous water analysis of well water from inhabitants of Rovinka",More than 16 million inhabitants of Central Europe.,Slovakia,Europe,"Slovakia has the largest natural groundwater reservoir in Central Europe - Žitný ostrov or 'Rye Island'. Its water originally comes from The Danube river. At current average consumption, it can supply more than 16 million inhabitants, Slovakia itself has 5 million. The current hydrological conditions are strongly influenced by the construction of the Gabčíkovo Water Structure (electricity plant). The land use of the area is devoted mainly to agricultural purposes. Podunajska Lowland area is supposed to suffer from droughts according to long-term predictions. During the summer of 2022, parts of Europe experienced drought conditions exacerbated by heat waves. The quality of underground sources of drinking water is insufficiently controlled. State authorities under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of the Environment, responsible for monitoring the quality of water resources, do not have sufficient and accurate information. The early warning system does not work, there is no information about possible sources of pollution, or the databases are not linked, so they do not reach those who are supposed to have them in real time. Slovakia lacks a central register of point and surface sources of groundwater pollution (e.g. factories, wastewater treatment plants, agricultural, large residential agglomerations), which is a key tool in an effective water protection system. Sources of drinking water are threatened by increasing pollution by various substances penetrating into underground reservoirs. Therefore, the question of healthy and sustainable development of society is how to protect this precious and irreplaceable wealth, because we can lose it through our own carelessness.","The quality of the water we drink is an existential issue. Up to 80% of the supply of drinking water in the Slovak Republic is provided by underground water sources. Therefore, the protection of groundwater resources should be our primary concern. How is it in reality? The water should be monitored better and more often, the public should have better access to the results of analysis and potential risks. The discussion should be focused on the current state of surface and underground water quality in the Žitný ostrov, the measures that can mitigate the consequences of environmental burdens should be taken as soon as possible. Žitný ostrov is directly and unstoppably endangered by chemical pollution leaking from Vrakuňa landfill with  the waste from production of former Chemical Plants of Georgi Dimitrov, but also by other industrial activities in Bratislava. Rovinka is the first village in the direction of groundwater flow from Bratislava to Žitný ostrov. That is why we started to have done our own water analysis since 2019. It should be our priority to clean these land mines affecting the ground water negatively. Also spreading awareness why the clean water matters is task that should not be underestimated.","The Government of the Slovak Republic

The Zero Water Day Partnership, ZWDP supports and facilitates a network of schools around the world to actively participate in climate change and planetary health policy dialogue, learn with and from other children and students across regions and countries, and enable them to translate and apply their learning in their local communities.    

The overarching goal of Saving the World‘s Water Towers Campaign is to empower and engage children and youth around the world to protect mountain areas from the impact of climate change through networked and collective action in the 5 areas of critical importance to humanity and the planet.  

The Saving the World‘s Water Towers Campaign aims to scale up the ZWDP Children’s Call to Action commitments and objectives. Concrete actions will include:

ZWDP website that provides a platform to communicate and share learning and experiences, projects and case studies, and reporting on water and mountain issues; 
	Create opportunities for children and youth to develop policy briefs and to present at UN conferences, in particular COP Climate Change Summits,
	Roll-out and scale-up the ZWDP Mountain Protector Training Programme in primary and secondary schools, as well as to other groups,
	Expand the idea of Planetary Health Weather Stations at schools to measure, understand and visualise complex problems related to climate change and mountain conservation using the 17 Sustainable Development Goals and their targets (SDGs), and to assess the impact of action at a local level (SDG indicators adapted to the site and setting), 
	Enhance alignment between school curricula on education for sustainable development and local government strategies and programmes, and through whole school-whole community partnerships generate relevant local level data on climate and disaster risk to guide and inform preparedness, adaption and mitigation with focused attention on educational and health facilities, water management systems and sustainably built infrastructure;
	Promote action for sustainable mountain tourism by engaging and training mountain professionals and mountain guides and indigenous people to become mountain protector trainers who can actively support school education programmes and community projects,
	Establish annual hybrid event in Germany for International Mountain Day that establishes a platform to present; SWWT projects and results, science and its communication, showcase planetary health weather stations, the work of mountain protectors in sustainable mountain tourism. 
The SWWT campaign has been developed and implemented within the framework of the Mountain Partnership Secretariat.

 ","The Zero Water Day Partnership campaign 'Saving the World‘s Water Towers' is grounded in Sustainable Development goal targets 4.7, 12.8 and 13.3. It promotes a consistent, coherent and mutually reinforcing approach to education for sustainable development and global citizenship education as part of a lifelong learning process. The campaign enables and empowers children and students to learn with and from each other, and play an active and effective role in global advocacy through participation in international conference and policy dialogue.

Mountains are the water towers of the world. The Zero Water Day Partnership planetary health weather station network supports schools as learning hubs, which can share and exchange data and information in a comparable way.

            Development of a research group to support government initiatives towards the establishment of a new national water resources research institution",Partner institutions,Hungary,Europe,"One of the Sustainable Development Goals aims to ensure sustainable water management, which calls for interdisciplinary and holistic approaches. The primary goal of the present National Laboratory is, therefore, to substantially broaden the knowledge base on fluvial and lacustrine systems (e.g. River Danube, or Lake Balaton and Lake Neusiedl), considering inherent complexity and interactions in their hydrology, hydrodynamics, morphology, water quality and ecology for a smarter and more secure subsurface, agricultural, rural and urban water management and for more advanced waste water treatment technologies. Cooperation of the most acknowledged Hungarian research institutions in water management, covering all relevant fields, including the above mentioned topics, ensures interdisciplinarity.","Water security and vulnerability issues are of prime social interest in Hungary. Climate change and socio-economic development threaten ecosystem services and infrastructure (drinking water supply, wastewater disposal, sustainability of irrigation, inland navigation, suitability of natural waters, etc.). The NL will improve social sustainability and resilience through enhancing water security, reducing vulnerability and diminishing water-related risks (related to droughts and floods).
In short term, benefits to society will manifest in improved water security strategy and social resilience. In the long term, a scientific background institute for Hungarian water management will be established. Complex water management issues adaptable to other countries will be developed.
A basic objective of NL is a status evaluation of various surface and groundwater bodies in unprecedented detail using in situ and laboratory measurements and computer simulations. The assessment will be carried out in an integrated manner considering the inherent complexity and central importance of climate change. AI-based, highly digitalized approaches meet environmental, social and economic demands towards water bodies. More details of the proposed scientific activities are provided in section III (attached spreadsheet).
Proposed outcomes:
•	>150 scientific publications in national and international journals;
•	New, smart monitoring and data processing systems implemented in practice;
•	>15 EU project proposals (e.g. Horizon Europe);
•	Knowledge transfer to university curricula;
•	Development of a research group to support government initiatives towards the establishment of a new national water resources research institution.","Budapest University of Technology and Economics

A modest budget (60.000 euros on average) is mobilized for each incubated projects. The funding is used by an operator to provide technical assistance for the production of project proposals, from a project idea to a concept note that is mature enough to be submitted to donors of the climate finance for financing of the projects implementation (with a leverage effect from 1 to 100).
Projects targeted involve actors and users of water resources in the basins of lakes, rivers and aquifers (including cities, companies and, where applicable, desalination actors) and mobilize efficient adaptation solutions, not only grey infrastructures, but also soft and green infrastructures linked to water resources management. Projects must focus on the following three types of actions:
1.	Knowledge for adaptation (monitoring networks, data, water information systems, hydro-climatic modeling, early-warning systems),
2.	Nature-Based Solutions for adaptation in action plans and basin management (ecosystem services, aquatic environment and wetland restoration),
3.	Governance and sustainable financial mechanisms for adaptation (institutional capacity building, training of the staff, consistency of sectoral policies, impact studies, vulnerability studies, flood and drought prevention action plans, adaptation strategy).","There is a necessity to improve integration of water and climate actions at basin level and to bridge the existing gap between donors (facing difficulties to find sound projects to finance) and project holders (lacking capacities to satisfy the complex project cycle preparation and access climate finance).
By bridging the gap between projects holders and donors and by integrating water and climate actions at basin level to ensure critical mass of cumulated benefits, the incubator will accelerate the implementation of the SDG dedicated to water.
Because the incubator supports the development of projects adopting the approach of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) at basin level, it will accelerate the implementation of SDGs beyond the sole SDG 6 dedicated to water.
Projects incubated will develop interlinkages between public policies interdependent with the water sector.
In particular, it will accelerate the implementation of the most water-related SDGs: SDG2 (agriculture), SDG7 (energy), SDG13 (climate) and SDG15 (biodiversity).
In brief, the expected results is the detection and development of water and climate projects that can be submitted to donors for financing of their implementation, with a leverage effect from 1 to 100.","International Office for Water (OiEau)

Given the above, the General Law on Water Resources was submitted to the Legislative Assembly and approved in December 2021 by the government of President Nayib Bukele. Article 10 establishes the institutional framework and creates the Salvadoran Water Authority, which began its operations on July 12, 2022 to assure the enforcement and compliance of the law. Hence, the Salvadoran Water Authority turns into the superior, deliberative, guiding, and normative body in terms of water resources policy.

In order to comply with the Sustainable Development Goals, specifically SDG 6: Drinking Water and Sanitation, two major strategic objectives were defined within the Institutional Strategic Plan of the Salvadoran Water Authority:

To promote the integrated management of water resources for the well-being of the population and the development of economic, social, and environmental activities in a sustainable manner.
	To develop innovative solutions that generate value by materializing the human right to water and sanitation.
The strategic actions that will ensure compliance with the above mentioned objectives are as follows:

Water Resources Management: this strategic action is focused on facilitating water resource management and its efficient use in accordance with the provisions of the Law, as well as its sustainability and water security, orienting it to changes in user behavior, in order to benefit the population.
	Research + Development + Innovation (R+D+i) to Improve the Quality of Life: Creates and develops innovative solutions by applying agile methodologies that utilize results-based project management to generate value for the population and an impact on the environment.
	Institutional Strengthening: Develops the potential of collaborators, works to strengthen the institutional identity of the Salvadoran Water Authority, and establishes long-term relationships with institutions and organizations of interest to generate alliances and cooperation bonds.
	Promotion of the Circular Water Economy: Promotes the sustainable development of water resources, generating a positive impact on the population and recognizing the full value of the resource.","It is expected that the implementation of specific actions will generate regulations for water resources including its uses, permits, and allocations. In addition, actions focused on water audits will be carried out to guarantee the population the adequate use and disposal of treated water. All these efforts will be supported by the creation of a new water culture, which will allow academic institutions to incorporate in their curricula a new form of water management from homes, schools and, of course, higher education institutions. This will generate awareness and commitment to the proper use of water and its final disposal in the country's different bodies of water.

In addition, projects that incorporate an innovative approach will be encouraged. Research and the development of projects that incorporate technological elements and world best practices will also be promoted. These will be measured through mid-term evaluations which will lead to improvements in the implementation process.

The development of projects focused on a circular water economy will be supported, fostering the reuse of water in all its dimensions and contributing directly to water security. Transboundary work for the protection of the watersheds that are shared with El Salvador's neighboring countries will also be encouraged.

As part of the continuous improvement of the Salvadoran Water Authority, capacities and material resources will be strengthened, such as equipment, infrastructure, and tools. This will allow the execution of tasks in an efficient and agile manner, which will contribute directly to the integral management of water resources.","United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC)

The overall goal of Making Water Count is to increase access to safe water and sanitation solutions that are inclusive, sustainable and scalable. Achieving this is twofold: On one hand, it is needed to bridge the service gap of the WASH sector. This means, directly developing the WASH market by supporting innovations and scaling up proven solutions until they are investment ready, without distorting the market.

the whole ecology impacted by the health of the River Shannon.
As it is part of a wider awareness raising about a Rights of Nature approach, all the people of Ireland and Northern Ireland (and further afield) seek to benefit from this project.",Ireland,Europe,"Aim: Building support and recognition for the rights of the River Shannon as a separate legal entity.
Rights of Nature is a way of re-thinking our relationship with nature: from one of dominance to one of sharing, caring, respect and interdependency. It can also act as a catalyst to shift our thinking from an extractive economy towards a regenerative economy. The idea of nature having rights is not new. Nature has rights. What is new is how we can intervene using a rights of nature lens to protect nature and to recognise the intrinsic rights of ecosystems and species to evolve, flourish, and regenerate.
This is a rights of nature based project. At 360.5km long the River Shannon is Ireland and the British Isles' longest river, draining the international Shannon basin of over 18000 sqkm which extends into Northern Ireland at Fermanagh. Culturally, the river and its Goddess Sionann feature extensively in Irish mythology and folklore. 
The river and its basin are extremely important ecologically, hosting multiple SACs and SPAs, including at: Lough Derg, Lough Ree and the Shannon Estuary. 
However the river and its habitats are poorly managed with latest reports showing continual water quality decline and habitat/species loss. Ireland continues to breach the Water Framework Directive by allowing unlicensed abstraction to persist and untreated sewage to be issued directly into the river at several points. The Shannon Estuary, as Ireland's deepest port, is home to several large industries - and there is huge ongoing concern about the pollution of the estuary and the local environs from these said industries.
On 26 January 2023, the European Commission decided to refer Ireland to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) for failing to correctly transpose the Water Framework Directive (Directive 2000/60/EC) into national law.  The basis for these infringement proceedings is that, despite some progress being made by the adoption of new legislation in June and December 2022, the Commission considered that the Irish authorities had not yet fully addressed the issues previously raised by the Commission.
A complex patchwork of regulatory organisations has created uncertainty over responsibility for tackling pollution incidents and species protection, with critical incidents such as oil spills often going unaddressed. Ongoing issues have been raised by activists such as Ecofact for many years with failure by the State to address the situation with several manmade structures on the river blocking fish passage for migrating species such as threatened Salmon and protected species Eel.
A dramatic paradigm shift in attitude to and respect for the River Shannon is needed, and those who are concerned with its protection need to be brought together under one umbrella.
Objectives:
1) Drafting a declaration on the rights of the River Shannon.
2) Building support with a coalition of NGO signatories to the declaration.
3) Building support with the river communities up and down the Shannon.
4) Forming a Community of Protectors/Guardians of the River.
5) Beginning a campaign for national recognition of the rights of Ireland’s greatest River.","1) Bringing together a community of NGOs and citizens who share the goal of protecting Ireland’s greatest river.
2) Raising awareness of the gaps in current protection and implementation regimes for managing the river.
3) Generating information on the fragmented regulatory regime.
4) Beginning a national conversation about our relationship with the river, and its cultural and ecological significance.","Environmental Justice Network Ireland (EJNI)

Structured as a an independent NGO and public-private partnership, Current represents the region's leading water utilities, research institutions, corporate water stewards, and innovation and advocacy community. Key initiatives from 2023-2030 include:
We are strengthening the blue economy to connect the environmental and economic ecosystems. We will soon release a first-of-its-kind comprehensive inclusive blue economy growth strategy for Chicago and Illinois: “Upstream Illinois: Strategies to Boost Illinois’ Blue Economy”. It identifies critical investment pathways for workforce development, entrepreneurship, and innovation. One of the strategies identified is an accelerator program supporting commercialization of water technology startups. In 2022, Current led an application to the U.S. Economic Development Administration Build to Scale competition, informed by this research, and was awarded a $516,639 grant to support the development of an accelerator program.
We are helping communities access federal funding to address critical water infrastructure needs. Beginning in 2023, Current will provide technical assistance to utilities and community partners engaged in water infrastructure projects as a partner to the Delta Institute-led U.S. EPA Region 5 Environmental Finance Center (EFC). The EFC will help communities access federal funding for water infrastructure projects that improve public health and environmental protection and advance environmental justice. During this five-year project, Current will provide customized workshops and technical assistance, engaging our expert network of researchers, utility and industry end users, entrepreneurs, and community and civic partners.  
We are building partnerships to test new solutions and take promising solutions to scale. Since our founding, Current has supported 4 water pilot projects and the commercialization of more than 20 different water technologies and has secured over $10 million in funding to support water technology development in the region. We were thrilled to receive a Chicago Innovation Award in November 2022 for our work on H2NOW Chicago, a major honor and a testament to the wide range of partners in this public-private collaboration to build public interest climate technology for the Chicago River. Current was also part of the Chicago Innovation Award-winning Discovery Partners Institute team, who won for their work on the Illinois and Chicago Wastewater Surveillance program.
We are fostering a strong network of water innovators, connecting industry leaders, researchers, entrepreneurs, investors, industry, and community.  In 2022, Current hosted 31 events – including our flagship event, Chicago Water Week – reaching nearly 2,000 attendees. By creating this platform, we have amplified the work of other water-focused organizations, including Friends of the Chicago River, Blacks in Green and Faith in Place. Planning for Chicago Water Week 2023 is underway as we speak. Also in 2023, we are preparing to launch a new Industry Consortium comprised of our region’s leaders on sustainability and water technology innovation. We have begun to identify our inaugural corporate leaders for this effort, and we are seeking the participation of design and engineering firms with strong interests in innovative water technologies in the built environment.","Current's mission sits at the intersection of inclusive economic growth and environmental protections for water, positioning collaborative innovation as one of the drivers of opportunity across these goals.

The lack of regulation, increased demand and competition over water resources have all increased conflict over water resources. This has led to an increase in influence and control over water resources by prominent community members, mainly men, leaving marginalized community members with insufficient water for their basic needs. 
Through this project, women and girls will learn to take leadership roles in preventing and managing conflicts associated with water scarcity in their communities. This way, the project will simultaneously contribute to reducing conflict drivers, enhancing social cohesion, and empowering women and girls.","The approach used has multiple impacts, including:

The working conditions, skills and formalization of those working for WASH were central to these campaigns.  Since then, these linkages have been incorporated into the work of UN-Water.
Despite the universally recognized rights to water and sanitation, in 2017 there were almost 230,000 work-related deaths attributed to communicable diseases; in Africa, they are the highest cause of work-related deaths. For women globally, work-related deaths attributed to communicable diseases were the most common reason, with 32.5 per cent of the total. Many of the communicable diseases are directly related to contributing and preventable factors linked to poor drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, and the lack of knowledge thereof. Poor WASH conditions are a frequent cause of both morbidity and mortality worldwide. There is limited knowledge in middle- and low-income countries on WASH in non-household settings, such as workplaces and data show that WASH access is lower in workplace settings than in household settings.
Since workplaces represent a major focus in the life of workers and employers, access to WASH in workplaces can contribute greatly to both occupational and general health. The challenges are diverse, and are addressed in the handbook:
-	Access to safe drinking water can also reduce the risk of dehydration and other heat-related illnesses.
-	Certain workplace conditions can pose water-related health risks for workers and the broader community requiring appropriate risk management strategies and control measures
-	Regular washing ensures that workers clean their bodies from germs and do not bring them to their families when they return from work.
-	Access to toilets in the workplace and appropriate breaks to use them prevent diseases, including open defecation.
-	Access to facilities for laundering, food hygiene and menstrual hygiene create working environments that increase well-being and prevent disease.
As part of the World Toilet Day campaign in 2016, the ILO published a self-training handbook titled WASH@Work.  It was elaborated in collaboration with UNICEF, the UN Foundation, WaterAid, the World Business Council for Sustainable Development, and Water and Sanitation for the Urban Poor.  It includes modules dedicated to governments, workers’ organizations and employers, providing advice on implementing ten ILO Conventions, eleven Recommendations and 18 Codes of Practice that have standards on access to water, sanitation and hygiene (including menstrual hygiene) for workplaces and workers’ housing in diverse economic activities.  A second edition, dedicated to mid-level managers and union representatives, was validated with tea plantation employers and unions in Malawi and has been translated into the Chewa and Malagasy languages.  It intends to support the achievement of both SDGs 6 and 8 by leveraging the ILO’s normative mandate to improve access to WASH for workers and improve their working conditions.
The ILO commits to a Wash@Work campaign to build awareness and facilitate policy development around access to WASH facilities at the workplace","The Wash@Work campaign will:
1. Increase the awareness among governments, employers, and workers about the importance of access to water and adequate sanitation and hygiene;
2. help configure workplaces to make them appropriate for workers to adequately and conveniently access WASH provisions;
3. equip workers and employers with tools to supervise the provisions of WASH installations and facilities.
4. promote the adoption of policies to implement the many international labour standards that support access to WASH, including menstrual hygiene, in workplaces and workers’ housing.

Also, the ILO is working with its tripartite constituents on issues related to water and sanitation to identify and implement priorities for investment infrastructure to support job creation opportunities while bringing safe water to communities.
The ILO, through its Employment Intensive Investment Programme (EIIP), supports member States in addressing unemployment and underemployment through public investment, typically in infrastructure development.  The EIIP programme uses an employment lens to build national and local capacities to implement inclusive infrastructure in the water and sanitation sector that have an economic, social and environmental impact. The following are examples of projects on water and sanitation that have been implemented in several countries where the programme provides technical support:
-	In Nargis, Myanmar: Implemented a post-crisis emergency response to support livelihood recovery through a combination of access-improvement infrastructures and sanitation facilities in cyclone-affected areas.
-	In Gonaives, Haiti: Implemented watershed management to support environmental protection while providing income support to vulnerable communities and building resiliency against extreme weather events.
-	In the Philippines: Implemented a post-crisis response to provide income support with the environmental objective of rehabilitating water facilities including watershed management in affected communities as well as livelihood development for indigenous tribal peoples.
-	In Jordan: Implemented adaptation works and peacebuilding initiatives through the construction of green community assets.
-	In Sudan: Implemented a special public works programme on the water sector to address adverse effects of drought in agricultural areas.
-	In Kebribeyah and Jigjiga, Ethiopia: Supported socio-economic recovery to flood-affected communities and installed flood protection and mitigation measures and water and sanitation interventions through infrastructure works.
-	In Nicaragua, Panama and Paraguay: Supported improving local capacity to plan, build and manage water resources with indigenous and rural communities.  
These interventions successfully demonstrated the use of local resource-based approaches to optimize job creation content while improving community assets, protecting the environment and promoting gender equality and social inclusion. The Water Action Agenda aspires to address the global crisis on water in order to accelerate progress in the second half of the Water Action Decade 2018-2028 and the second half of the 2030 Agenda. The ILO's contribution through its initiatives across the domain of water points to the need to scale up implementation and promote the discourse at the global level to support a concerted action towards achieving goals 6 &8. 
As such, the ILO commits to action towards investing more in improving national and local capacities to support sustainable public investments across the domain of water while contributing to the acceleration of jobs, social protection and social justice.","The initiatives and interventions of the ILO through the EIIP will:
1. Improve national and local capacities to implement public investments in the water and sanitation sector while maximizing job creation outcomes and application of normative principles to promote decent work agenda and advance social justice.
2. Promote an enabling environment to support employment-intensive reforms
3. Develop indicators to promote gender equality and social inclusion in water infrastructure development
4. Promote greater knowledge-sharing through research and identification of challenges to decent work and public investments in the water domain
5. Pursue partnerships with the UN System, IFIs, regional partners and other like-minded institutions to maximize the synergy of benefits and impacts","National and Local Authorities

At the same time, cities are part of a solution in which water is a unifying force, a catalyst and a leverage for sustainable development. Water is at the heart of all major challenges we are facing. When tackling these, it takes millions to invest billions wisely. In ancient Egypt, workers used the lever to move and uplift obelisks weighing more than 100 tons. We do the same, using water as leverage. Integrated water solutions should always be connected to, and subsequently will have an indispensable positive impact on reaching social, economic, ecological and climate goals.
Water as Leverage (WaL) aims to achieve three transitions:
I.	Breaking through the lock-in. Worldwide there is still not enough money allocated nor accounted for funding the pre project-preparation phase. This phase, including research, inclusive collaboration, coalition building, sparking the enabling environment, capacity building, design and innovation, demands public-private collaboration, in a ‘challenge’ context (pressure-cooker). This unlocks the millions to invest billions wisely.
II.	breaking through the fragmentation in the project development process. We aim for active involvement of all stakeholders – local communities, public, private and financial sectors – from the start in infrastructural project development;
III.	breaking away from the narrow focus on projects. We need to broaden the scope to both projects ánd process, and the necessary enabling environment. It is about people, process and projects for sustainable impact.
“Water as Leverage”, initiated by the Netherlands government, is a proven approach for catalyzing just and sustainable urban water and climate resilience. It is an inclusive design-driven approach to develop, finance and implement projects that cut across sectoral and administrative boundaries, thereby across SDG’s. WaL Asia’s first phase materialized in over two dozen projects that catalyze resilience from the ground up using water as a lever for sustainable development and climate change action. Now Water as Leverage has launched new initiatives in the trilateral Wadden Sea region in Northern Europe and the city of Cartagena in Colombia. Through alliances with international financial institutions, resilience experts, academia, cities and local and international networks, new Water as Leverage trajectories will be started in sets of cities from now until 2030 to answer to the strong demand throughout the world.
Two components will materialize as part of this Water as Leverage upscaling initiative:
The Water as Leverage Factory will be set-up to provide opportunities to run WaL trajectories in urban landscapes in different countries, provide process guidance to larger partners to drive own WaL trajectories and mobilize funding and finance.
The Water as Leverage Academy will nurture, enrich, and disseminate the Water as Leverage approach and culture across geographies, professional curricula, civil society and policy arenas. It will reach a wide range of stakeholders and water, adaptation and infrastructure practitioners and serve as a platform for students, alumni, professionals and decisionmakers to exchange knowledge, experiences and new ideas, exploring how the WaL approach can be applied in their landscapes.","By 2030, through implementing, upscaling and replicating the Water as Leverage approach, we commit to deliver:
•	An operational Water as Leverage Factory, in which governments (cities, regional and national), UN agencies, International Financial Institutions, foundations, NGO’s/CSO’s and research, education and knowledge institutes collaborate to develop and implement Water as Leverage initiatives, delivering transformative climate adaptation and water security strategies, programs and projects.
•	The strengthened capacity of hundreds and thousands of water practitioners and change makers- urban and rural - for inclusive, transformative climate adaptation and water security capacity through a Water as Leverage Academy in which students apply the Water as Leverage approach to real-life cases, contributing to the identification of new initiatives. 
With both initiatives and the Water as Leverage trajectories, we aim to contribute to sustainable water infrastructure projects completing the feasibility phase – ready for financing and implementation – contributing by 2030 to water security for 15 million people in urban landscapes around the world. With both the Factory and the Academy disseminating the Water as Leverage approach further and new upscaling partners joining, this number can grow to double or even tenfold the amount of people.
This ""Scaling-up Water as Leverage Globally for worldwide urban climate resilience"" initiative delivers across the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement, applying the SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework, and delivers impactful local projects. Principally, to the following SDG’s, but additionally to many more:
•	SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation lie at the foundation of a dignified human life. The Water as Leverage method aims to provide clean water and sanitation worldwide by facilitating sustainable water infrastructure projects.
•	SDG 8: Water as Leverage aims to provide localities with ownership of their local water infrastructure projects. By creating urgently needed infrastructure projects in vulnerable regions (such as deltas and savannas), we will also provide a stimulus to local economies.
•	SDG 11: Sustainability is a core feature of the Water as Leverage method. By spreading the WaL method on a global scale, we aim to create an ever increasing amount of communities that can sustain themselves on their available water supply in harmony with their environment through our integrated method.
•	SDG 13: Currently, most of the investments in infrastructure projects made on Earth are not conducive to climate action. WaL aims to make a fundamental change, transforming the way water infrastructure projects have been carried out.
•	SDG 17: Scaling up the Water as Leverage method will be the resounding success of a global network of partners. These partners are vital in providing both funds and expertise.","Netherland Enterprise & Development Agency (RVO)

The NWI has increased the efficiency of Australia’s water use, provided investment confidence and greater certainty for the environment, and improved water security for rural and urban communities.
While the NWI has had a strong positive impact, much has changed since its inception in 2004. The Australian Government has committed to renewing the national policy framework to account for contemporary water resource management issues.

This coalition seeks to align our laws with the laws of Nature, and in furtherance of this broader  goal, pledges support towards the Rights of Water Ecosystems and Aquatic Ecosystem initiatives and its aim of promoting solutions to restore the health, balance, and biodiversity of aquatic environments. 
Rights of Nature is a  powerful legal, non-anthropocentric, and holistic tool for water restoration and protection, ensuring water for climate, the environment and for people; addressing the global biodiversity loss and the effects of climate change; catalyzing the achievement of Access to clean water (SGD 6), Sustainable practices (SGD 12), Climate Action (SGD 13), Ecosystem restoration (SGD 15), among others.
The Alliance is seeking to advocate for governments to recognize water sources  as a rights-bearing entity, as a tool to regain the lost balance with our Planet and have a broad impact on the protection of the Rights of Nature, aquatic ecosystems, and global water governance. The Alliance will provide additional support to leading campaigns in the five continents enacting Nature's Rights in constitutions, national statutes, local laws, and at the supranational level as a more effective way to conserve, restore and ensure water sources for the environment and communities. Rights of Nature align legal standards and principles with planetary boundaries and the law of Nature. Those campaigns include, among others, the Universal Declaration for the Rights of Mother Earth, the Universal Declaration of Rights of Rivers, and the Universal Declaration of Ocean Rights (UDOR).
The alliance has developed follow-up mechanisms to monitor the advancement and impact of adopting and implementing the Earth Law framework through the Eco- jurisprudence Monitor interactive tool.","The actions of this Alliance are geared towards obtaining impact in two dimensions: a global paradigm shift of water governance and the adoption of new legal ecocentric principles and standards for water's ecosystem protection.
The Rights of Nature model seeks to recognize Nature and her elements as rights holders, providing them with a voice through representation, and reorienting western law around principles of relationship, interconnection, reciprocity, responsibility, and the recognition that all Earth's beings, ecosystems, and components have fundamental rights to exist, thrive, and evolve. 
This innovative framework represents a pathway towards transforming our relationship from dominion and separateness to holism and mutualism enhancement. Earth-centered legal systems are structured on more robust standards of protection that focus on maintaining the benefits of Nature not only for the human species but for Nature itself, in recognition of her intrinsic value.
Earth-centered initiatives are not mechanisms that only favor Nature in isolation. On the contrary, Rights of Nature is a cohesive element, acting as a bridge between human rights, in particular the human right to water, Indigenous rights, environmental rights (healthy environment), and biocultural rights. In unifying these different paradigms, Rights of Nature promotes a holistic approach to addressing and achieving the SDGs.  Recognizing Nature as a subject of rights empowers people to hold their governments accountable for harmful environmental degradation. It encourages the participation and inclusion of diverse stakeholders in implementation structures,  including Indigenous Peoples and traditional knowledge, and non-human entities such as Nature and Water.  Repositioning people and Nature as members of a collective whole working together towards a shared vision of a healthy and livable planet,  promotes  holistic water management approaches. Moreover, Rights of Nature places Water at the center of governance actions, representing an opportunity for progress in implementing the international, national and local agenda linked to sustainable development and the SDGs.
Earth-centered legal initiatives provide mechanisms to ensure that natural systems do not collapse and become incapable of continuing their environmental functions. Instead, the comprehensive incorporation of standards and laws guarantees the necessary support for the health of ecosystems in accordance with Nature’s needs.  For example, Ecuador's framework provides interesting legal tools to orient the choices of decision-makers; all people have universal rights to represent Nature and can bring suit in her name. Also, Ecuador has introduced a series of ecocentric principles: principle of precaution, prevention, in dubio pro natura, non regression, tolerance, among others which have been key to stopping development projects threatening the integrity of Nature and preserving biodiversity under an ecosystemic oriented governance.
There are several examples of aquatic ecosystems that are being governed or have been protected through legal models based on the Rights of Nature, e.g. Galapagos Marine Reserve (Ecuador), Manglares Cayapas Mataje Ecological Reserve (Ecuador), Whanganui River (New Zealand), Atrato River (Colombia), Magpie River (Canada), Mar Menor ( Spain), among others. We seek to scale this impact globally and achieve its effective implementation, to reach a permanent transformation in our aquatic ecosystems governance for the benefit of Nature and communities.","Aruba Government

‘Cultural flows’ are water entitlements that are legally and beneficially owned by First Nations. First Nations require water entitlements of a sufficient and adequate quantity and quality to improve the spiritual, cultural, natural, environmental, social and economic conditions of those Nations.
The Australian Government has committed to deliver the Aboriginal Water Entitlements Program (AWEP).  This represents a $40 million AUD investment to support Murray–Darling Basin First Nations communities’ to increase their holdings of cultural and economic water entitlements, and to carry out associated planning activities.","Water is central to the cultural, social and spiritual identity of Australia's First Nations people, as well as to their livelihoods.  However, First Nations people remain distant from the benefits of water ownership and participation in the water market. While legislative reforms in Australia that have recognised First Nations peoples’ land rights and native title have enabled recognition of some First Nations rights across Australia, pathways to water access and ownership are not accessible for all First Nations people. Current data suggests that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations hold no more than 2.32% of total water entitlements across the nation.
An investment in water entitlements will ensure that First Nations peoples have a secure option to maintain and grow their water rights in perpetuity, and will help support the cultural and economic benefits that arise from water ownership.",First Nations peoples,"Goal 6, Goal 10",,"Sat, 10/01/2022 - 12:00","Sun, 12/31/2023 - 12:00",,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05494505494505515

With Australian and international partners, AquaWatch will co-design and build an extensive network of purpose-designed Earth observation satellites and ground-based sensors to monitor the quality of Australia’s rivers and coastal and inland waterways with near real-time data provision and predictive analysis. AquaWatch Australia aims to provide actionable information on the water quality of inland and coastal waters in Australia and in other countries.","AquaWatch will provide a new source of timely and accessible information on water quality across the Australian landscape. The system will support water managers, industry and research partners to implement actions to minimise the impacts from natural event such as toxic algal blooms, and monitor drinking water contamination and excess runoff from irrigation. The AquaWatch system will inform better water quality management practices, which in turn will increase the resilience of rural and regional communities that depend on water for agriculture and improve environmental outcomes. As well as monitoring the health of inland rivers, dams and waterways, AquaWatch will also have potential application to monitor coastal wetlands, aquaculture farms, riparian vegetation and terrestrial biodiversity, desalination plants, mine sites, mangroves and coral reef environments. AquaWatch is working with international partners in Vietnam, Malaysia, Chile, Colombia, the United States and elsewhere on pilot projects outside Australia. These sites will inform the development of AquaWatch increasing its suitability for global applications.

            A growing number of private sector companies contributing to safely managed sanitation as a utility service, including service providers across the sanitation service chain with a new category of providers delivering transformative new products",,Global,"Africa, Asia and Pacific","The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation is dedicated to supporting the achievement of SDG 6.2 and to helping catalyze the widespread use of safely managed sanitation services, which contribute to positive health, economic, and gender equality outcomes for communities.

Through our work, we hope to draw attention to sanitation, which is a neglected issue, yet has immense potential to improve people’s lives, especially the lives of women, girls, and marginalized communities who suffer disproportionately from the burdens of poor sanitation.

In 2020, 3.6 billion people—nearly half the world’s population—used sanitation facilities and services that are not safely managed. When human waste is not safely managed it undermines individual dignity and potential, and it contaminates water, soil, and food. This contamination has significant knock-on effects, such as increasing the disease burden and impeding socio-economic development for communities and countries.

The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation has already committed $370 million to grantee partnerships, between 2023-2026, to accelerate safe sanitation through three interlinked and essential pathways:

Strong national policy: Strong national sanitation policies, regulations, and institutions that set clear frameworks and fund public service systems for the delivery of safe, inclusive sanitation services, are vital for progress in Africa, and around the world. A model of this is the African Sanitation Policy Guidelines, developed by the African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW), which government leaders in many African nations are adopting as a key step in transforming the state of sanitation for their citizens.
	 
	Inclusive and sustainable sanitation services: City-wide Inclusive Sanitation (CWIS) is a best practice, public-service approach for implementing inclusive and sustainable urban sanitation systems for all, especially those in low-income communities. This approach is designed around the combinations of infrastructure and technologies that exist in most cities—sewered and non-sewered, formal and informal. It takes advantage of systems that are already working well, and adapts and strengthens their equity, safety, and sustainability.
	 
	Breakthrough sanitation innovations: Innovative sanitation technologies, like the reinvented toilet and the omni-processor, can open exciting opportunities, including new business models, public-private partnerships, and product offerings. These are needed to deliver a new era of safe sanitation for households, communities, and countries, and to reach people who have the least access. These technologies can also provide valuable climate co-benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions while increasing the resilience of urban services and infrastructure in the face of flooding or water shortages.
	Over the last 12 years, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, has supported the development of new technologies to provide sanitation access to the billions of urban residents not connected to sewer systems. Today, the foundation is developing commercial pathways to scale up production and use of these technologies in markets which can benefit the most from new solutions.
Together, these pathways support and complement the ongoing work of governments, businesses, innovators, and local community leaders by providing the tools, capacity, and technology that they may need to make progress towards safe, inclusive sanitation for all.","Through diverse and equitable partnerships, our desired impact is to fundamentally transform the sanitation sector to reach universal use of sustainable sanitation, contributing to better health, economic, and gender quality outcomes for the world’s underserved.","The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation works with diverse partners to deliver on these commitments, including governments, UN agencies, civil society, research institutions, industry partners developing and commercializing the next generation of sanitation innovations, and others: Governments of Senegal, India, Bangladesh, South Africa, China, and others; Development financial institutions, including World Bank, Islamic Development Bank, African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, French Development Agency, USAID, and others; Multilateral partners, including African Ministers Council on Water, African Water and Sanitation Association, East & Southern Africa Water and Sanitation Regulators Association, Pan-African Sanitation Actors Association, UNICEF, World Health Organization, International Water Association, UNHABITAT, and others; Research Institutions; Commercial Partners; and Non-Governmental-Organizations, among others.",Goal 6,6.2,"Sun, 01/01/2023 - 12:00","Thu, 12/31/2026 - 12:00","For more information about the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's work on transformative sanitation technologies, read this article by Dr. Doulaye Kone, Deputy Director, Water, Sanitation & Hygiene: https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ideas/articles/sanitation-reinvent-toilet .",0.125,0.5555555555555556,0.0,0.75,1.0,0.05494505494505515

CAF expresses its voluntary commitment to support progress to achieve SDG6 and water-related SDGs in the LAC region by:
1)	Present and disseminate the CAF Water Strategy 2023-2026 among its shareholder countries and the international community. It establishes the institution’s lines of action for Water Security and its strategic objectives, which are: (i) Integrated Water Resource Management for flood control, drought management and improved water governance; (ii) Safe, inclusive, equitable, and efficient access to water and sanitation; (iii) Reduction of water and urban solid waste pollution; and (iv) Access to irrigation to promote resilient family and intensive agriculture.
2)	Significantly increase funding for Water Security Projects to enable healthier, more inclusive and climate resilient communities and contribute to the reduction of gaps under SDG6 of the 2030 Agenda.  
3)	Continue the acceleration of sustainable and high-quality projects, through the extension of the CAF-PPSA Water Project Preparation Program, which allocated USD 20 million of non-reimbursable CAF resources since 2019, enabling an investment of up to USD 1.4 billion in water infrastructure projects, benefiting 6.5 million inhabitants in Latin America and Caribbean. 
4)	Catalyze greater investment and pre-investment resources from other international agencies and donors, as well as encourage greater participation of the private sector, to expand the portfolio of water projects and boost the reduction of gaps in the region.
5)	Provide continuity and greater synergy with International Financial Institutions and relevant global entities, to increase the number of actors and resources oriented to Water Security, by continuing its ties with the Water Financing Coalition that is part of the Finance in Common alliance of banks; the Conference of Ibero-American Water Directors (CODIA); the World Water Council; and the Global Water Partnership, among others.
6)	Strengthen CAF's positioning as a relevant actor in international fora and events by hosting and co-organizing them throughout the year and by maintaining its presence in global events such as the World Water Forum, World Water Week, and regional events such as LATINOSAN and the CAF Water Dialogues.
7)	Contribute to the governance of water resources and their services, at local, national and transboundary levels, through sectoral dialogue, knowledge generation, and information exchange, which are the basis for cooperation, coordination and peace, and by continuing to support river basin organizations. Likewise, CAF will continue to promote the adoption of corporate governance, transparency and accountability practices.
8)	Promote technological and financial innovation in the water sector, through the development of instruments and tools for greater efficiency and sustainability in the implementation of water programs and projects, consistent with the corporate strategy of making CAF the Green Bank of Latin America and the Caribbean.  
9)	Lastly, transversal to the aforementioned commitments, promote sectoral actions and interventions that, under a holistic approach and interrelated with other sectors, contribute to economic reactivation, social development, and the protection of ecosystems. Water is the engine of sustainable development.","During 2023-2026, water programs and projects financed by CAF will benefit the most vulnerable population with no access or limited access to water and to sanitation, in more than 7 million people. 
Wastewater treatment projects are expected to benefit more than 10 million people, and besides their contribution to reduce pollution, those projects will be an opportunity to harness water reuse to mitigate droughts and water scarcity, especially in arid and semi-arid zones of the region, along with other measures in accordance with the International Drought Resilience Alliance pillars and its expected outcomes.
Water Security projects supported by CAF will also contribute to flood control, due to the high vulnerability of the region to them, by means of standalone urban drainage projects, or as part of urban development projects based on the several cases already implemented in Brazil and other countries in LAC. 
In addition, water governance will be enhanced at local, national, and transboundary levels by strengthening alliances and synergy within national and sub-national water agencies/players as well as with international bodies, promoting cooperation, information exchange, and more important, developing internal managerial capacities.
Considering water is connector to all sustainable development goals, benefits of water interventions are expected to have positive externalities in other sectors such as health, agriculture, forestry, renewable energy, transportation, tourism, decent housing, and education, contributing also to employment, gender equality, and inclusiveness, among others.","Argentina, Barbados, Plurinational State of Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Spain, Jamaica, México, Panamá, Paraguay, Perú, Portugal, Dominican Republic, Trinidad & Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela.","Goal 2, Goal 6, Goal 11, Goal 13, Goal 17","2.3, 2.4 , 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 17.1, 17.2, 17.3","Mon, 03/20/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 03/31/2026 - 12:00",,0.625,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.9890109890109927

As a pilot phase of this commitment, WMO is partnering with UNDRR, SOFF and the Red Cross in developing end-to-end early warning systems focused on floods and droughts titled ‘Water at the heart of climate action’ which will be implemented in Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda and which can be applied to other countries at a later stage. WMO will lead the Pillar 2 (earth system observations, monitoring and forecasting for floods and droughts) related outputs and ensure joint collaboration and coordination with Pillar 1 (led by UNDRR) and Pillar 3 (ITU) and 4 (Red Cross) activities.","Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda",Global,"This initiative contributes to the pillar 2 of the Early Warnings for All Initiative initiated by UN Secretary-General in 2022, to ensure that every person on Earth is protected by early warning systems by 2027.
Over the past 20 years, approximately 75 % of all disasters were water related, causing huge social and economic damage of almost US$700 billion. One important preparedness measure for combating the water-related disasters is to have effective and tailored early warning systems at local and regional scale.
A WMO survey  shows significant gaps in Multi Hazard Early Warning System (MHEWS) in many areas of the world with only half of WMO Members having an operational MHEWS in place. To develop an early warning system especially for flood and drought hazards, it is essential that reliable and temporally high resolved weather, climate, and water data are collected, analysed, and used by national and local actors for warning services as well as by global and regional centers like ECMWF for producing information. This information is crucial for a better understanding of  the water-energy-food- ecosystem nexus (interdependent systems; SDG 1, 2, 6, 7, 11, 13, and 15). WMO plays an important role in fostering collaboration between the NHMS and advocates for free and unrestricted exchange of data and information under the new WMO Unified Data Policy. Furthermore, WMO and its Members and partners co-develop products and services to improve social, economic welfare and the protection of the environment.   
WMO through its Technical Commissions, Research Board, Regional Associations and constituent/subsidiary bodies will:
1)	Contribute to the development and implementation of global/regional/national/basin scale coordinated systems for acquiring, processing, transmitting, and disseminating meteorological, climatological and hydrological observations and standards related to floods and droughts; and
2)	Support the development and implementation of user-focused spatio-temporal high-resolution modelling and forecasting tools and products based on principles of good practice and long-term sustainability.    
Key activities include:
1)	Enhancing capacity to understand hazards: Conduct gap analyses on early warning needs (national, regional) for different types of floods and droughts, and ensure timely access to, and use of satellite and surface observations (contributions and linkage with SOFF Initiative) and of advanced technologies to build up detection and forecasting capabilities;
2)	Accelerate the implementation of the WMO Plan for Action for Hydrology, including the establishment of global, regional, national and basin wide hydrological status and outlook systems (HydroSOS) as well as the establishment of hydrological centres of the WMO Integrated Processing and Prediction System (WIPPS);
3)	Development of Regional/National/Global data and products for flood (urban/flash/riverine/other types) and drought modeling and forecasting systems (including cryosphere) through, for instance, the Flash Flood Guidance System with Global Coverage (FFGS/WGC) and other existing tools and with current progress made in the world weather and world climate research programs; and
4)	Development of global, regional and national data and information visualization platforms for flood and drought early warning system including training to stakeholders by using best examples and methodologies of Associated Programme on Flood Management (APFM), Integrated Drought Management Programme (IDMP) etc.","A key action for measuring impact will be to strengthen capacities of the NMHSs (for monitoring, forecasting and dissemination of early warning systems) and improve community preparedness and resilience to water risks (SDG 6, 13, 11, 16).
Socio-economic sectors related activities are dependent on weather and water information for climate adaptation and actions pertaining to disaster risk reduction   actions.  Improved production of, and access to climate, weather and water observations and forecasts will support stakeholders at various (global, regional, national and local) scales. It will help to make informed decisions on water resources management  and the results will inform on impacts of possible disasters for population (SDG 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 13), transport and industries (SDG 9), and the environment (SDG 14). This is also critical for effective climate action (SDG 15). It will also support the implementation of the SDGs and Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction especially in the development of multi-hazard forecast and monitoring systems and foster international, regional and national cooperation and partnerships among countries (SDG 17). 
Following the work under this initiative, NMHSs will support various agencies in the countries related to disaster management, environment, water resources, climate change, agriculture, irrigation, power and dam authorities etc. with hydrological and meteorological regularly updated status information (i.e., hourly, daily, weekly, monthly) and prediction of events  in a timely manner. As monitoring of weather conditions and water flows require a transboundary/regional approach, this initiative will be instrumental in improving coordination and collaboration between NMHSs of countries.
Finally, the successful implementation of this initiative will also provide strategic and technical expertise to the humanitarian sector, International Organizations, NGOs etc. working on water, weather and climate change adaptation sectors. The forecasting and warning information will significantly contribute in reducing the number of deaths and the number of people affected and substantially decrease the direct socio-economic losses from the water-related disasters, with a focus on protecting the poor and people in vulnerable situations (SDG 11.5).","•	National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) of 193 WMO Member States and Territories

In 2023-2024, the Ministry of Public Works, together with the Environment, will develop the first 16 Strategic Plans (PERHC) in the pilot basins established to create the Basin Councils, complementing activities and objectives in case there are previous planning instruments.
In at least 10 of these pilot basins, a participatory governance model for water management will be applied, of an intersectoral nature and with territorial relevance, composed of representatives of the State - at the central, regional and communal levels -, the private sector, civil society and academia. This work is developed jointly with the Ministries of Agriculture and Environment, plus the country's 16 regional governors.

In the second half of 2023, studies will be completed on the impact on water tariffs due to the incorporation of secondary treatment for wastewater currently discharged through submarine outfalls in coastal areas. This will make it possible to differentiate between those that are economically viable and those that will require subsidies or public investment.
Between 2023 and 2024 a study will be carried out with a proposed law to stimulate the reconversion of submarine outfalls to wastewater treatment plants in coastal areas, for those cases where it is not economically viable to incorporate this additional treatment to wastewater.
By the second half of 2024 there will be a public policy proposal for debate (with a law initiative and budgetary needs) regarding the incorporation, in areas of water deficit, of a diversified matrix where a % of the water source can come from treated wastewater.
The public company ECONSSA Chile has stipulated that 70% of the wastewater generated by the city of Antofagasta will be reused by 2030, improving water quality and reducing pollution on the sea coast. To achieve this goal, the most appropriate business model will be defined in 2023, procurement and bidding processes will be completed in 2024, and construction will begin in late 2025, so that the first supply of treated water for reuse, with a treatment capacity of 900 l/s, will be available in 2029.","Significantly reduces water discharged into the sea along the Chilean coast, and reuses water from sewage treatment plants",People from urban communities,Goal 6,"6.2, 6.3","Mon, 03/20/2023 - 12:00","Mon, 01/22/2024 - 12:00",,0.25,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05494505494505515

million children – who live in areas of high or
extremely-high water vulnerability.
For too many people, drinking water services are not
safe and affordable. The situation is becoming more
challenging due to climate change, which can cause
droughts, floods and rising sea levels. These
problems can be addressed with the right
infrastructure, but for too many people water services
and communities are insufficiently resilient to climate
change.
Similarly, for many communities, there is a lack of
forward planning to prevent water scarcity crises
before they strike.
Water is also linked with another type of crisis – violent
conflict. In fact, water insecurity creates a vicious circle
with other drivers of conflict. Water can be the starting
cause of conflicts, particularly where it is scarce. And once
conflicts have begun, they can shift patterns of water use,
as populations are displaced and move to new locations.
With private and public sector partners, UNICEF is responding
to each of the critical water security challenges we face today.
UNICEF is facilitating safe and affordable drinking water
services. To achieve the greatest impact, we work with
governments, providing them with expertise on developing
policies and budgets for water, as well as technical assistance
on the water systems themselves. From 2018-2021 UNICEF
reached 69.9 million people with safe water services.
We are also building the climate resilience of water services
and communities. UNICEF ensures that water services can
withstand climate-related events, such as droughts and floods,
and are operated with low carbon energy sources, such as
solar power. From 2019-2021, UNICEF directly supported the
construction of 4,257 solar-powered water systems.
Preventing water scarcity crises through early action is another
vital area of work. We support water resource assessments,
sustainable groundwater abstraction, efficient water use, and
drought warning systems. These early actions help prevent
situations in which water supplies are fully depleted.
Finally, UNICEF believes in the power of facilitating water
cooperation for peace and stability. We work to ensure water
supplies are equitably distributed and do not contribute to
tensions between communities. We also work in conflict
zones, to prevent attacks on water infrastructure and
personnel, and to ensure all people affected by crisis can
access water.","As part of UNICEF’s Strategic Plan for 2022-2025, we aim to
reach 50 million people with climate-resilient and safe
drinking water, and support governments and partners in the
transition towards a climate-resilient sector.
With support for the four investment packages developed,
and through our network of partners in the WASH sector,
we aim to contribute to the even higher global targets

We commit, with budgetary support, to advance from 2023 in the creation of 25 Rural Sanitation Systems (RSS) per year in Semi-concentrated rural localities, (growing from 120 to 520 by 2030), going from 39 thousand homes (2022) with drinking water systems in such localities to 69,681 (2030); and increasing the current 124 thousand beneficiaries to 216 thousand by that year.
To meet this commitment, we will leverage a Results-Based Program for Just Water Transition, with partial financing from the World Bank, which will focus on improving the sustainability and resilience of rural water and sanitation providers (2023-2027). The Program includes investments for the construction, rehabilitation, improvement and conservation of RWSS systems.
The institutional framework of the country's Rural Sanitation Services will be strengthened in the current year 2023 and will begin by expanding the staffing (90 positions) and powers of the ministerial part, in accordance with the new legal framework.

These shortages may harm crop productivity and create challenges in accessing potable water for drinking and cooking. As a result, some evidence suggests that groundwater depletion and shortages may drive migration out of affected areas. Extreme weather events including droughts and floods can cause significant economic losses and out-migration of affected populations. Increasing water insecurity due to climate change thus can impact future human mobility and likely differentially harming the most vulnerable communities.
Population Council and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) together with researchers at the University of Bologna are exploring how groundwater depletion may be driving internal migration across the world, integrating an innovative satellite derived dataset on water depletion with over 150 micro-census data surveys containing information on international migration across 72 countries.   
The project also aims to understand how differential vulnerability shapes migration patterns. Here we employ the population vulnerability to climate change index (PVCCI) to understand how climate vulnerability may be a driver of migration with a focus on young migrants in select countries in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and the Latin America regions. A component of the PVCCI is related drought and water scarcity that can be highlighted in this exploratory analysis. Overall, this part of the initiative focuses on key case studies in twelve countries, to explore internal migration patterns in relation to PVCCI with a focus on how water scarcity may drive observed patterns. This also focuses on migration patterns observed among younger adults ages 15-24 years old.
Our preliminary results indicate that water depletion is a significant contributor to internal migration globally and that this effect has become stronger over time. Once we have completed our analyses we aim to publish at least two peer-reviewed papers, present findings at international conferences and contribute to the design of effective climate adaptation strategies to address the impacts of water depletion on human mobility, immobility, and the implications for population health and well-being. Our ultimate goal is to produce evidence needed for global migration and water policies.","Water is a critical resource for every dimension of human life and water scarcity thus has consequential impacts on human society.  Freshwater is critical for drinking, for agricultural productivity and for sanitation and hygiene. Access to safe drinking water and for use in agriculture is critical for sustainable economic development and human health. Studies have linked water insecurity with conflict, poor health outcomes, economic disruption, and increasingly with migration. Migration however is only mentioned once in the UN Summary Report as one potential key challenge to cooperation on water. 
Our action is research oriented and aims to highlight the link between water depletion and migration. This relates to SDG Goal 6, to bring attention to the need for available and sustainable management of water, to reduce the prevalence of water depletion. This also relates to Goal 12 regarding sustainable and consumption and production patterns, as water scarcity in some regions is driven by agriculture and related activities that may deplete water resources, particularly as climate change exacerbates this issue. As a result, our study will also relate to Goal 13, to take action on climate change and its impacts, including water scarcity.  We can also consider Goal 15 and how water depletion may relate to land degradation related to agriculture and demands on the environment, as well as climate change and how these may combine and result in desertification or droughts.   
 Lastly, migration has many implications regarding equity and justice. Migrants may be people that are displaced by a drought or by water depletion, disproportionately vulnerable to these disruptions and insecurities. However, in some cases it is possible that the most vulnerable people are immobile and unable to migrate, given potential costs and resources required.  We will explore how demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of migrants differentially contribute to or hinder mobility. This will be key to addressing SDG Goal 10 to reduce inequalities within and between countries.","International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA)

Climate change is predicted to worsen the situation by altering hydrological cycles, depleting the natural storage (glaciers, lakes, aquifers, soil moisture), making the hydrology cycle more unpredictable and increasing the frequency and intensity of floods and droughts.
By adopting the Water Code in 2020, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan committed to promote Integrated Water Resource Management and Planning as a tool to preserve and protect water resources for water supply, wastewater, irrigation, and flood management and to strategically link the beneficial uses of water over a broad spectrum of human and ecosystem needs for current and future generations. The National Water Resources Strategy aims at providing strategic guidance for long-term integrated water resources management in Tajikistan under climate change impact (both from the adaptation and mitigation aspects). It also aims at providing a strategic roadmap for implementation of the National Development Strategy 2030 (NDS) in the priority areas requiring sustainable use of water resources (ensuring energy security, ensuring food security, productive human capital, generation of employment and resilient infrastructure), and for different trajectories of economic growth. The strategy will also cover aspects of transboundary water cooperation.
The NWRS is expected to address the challenges of sector fragmentation at the basin and national scale, to achieve optimal allocative efficiency in water resources management. In many parts of the country, inadequate water management practices lead to enormous environmental challenges, resulting in increased underground water table, salinization of soil and erosion. The strategy will set priorities for dealing with complex and interlinked water challenges, also providing a necessary bridging policy between the hydrologically interconnected systems of surface and underground water resources and sectoral water use plans in order to ensure optimal use and protection of resources. The strategy will identify key investments in institutional strengthening, information management, and resilient infrastructure development. The strategy will also tackle institutional tools such as legal and regulatory frameworks, water pricing, and incentives needed to better allocate, regulate, and conserve water resources. The strategy will embed the importance of integrated information systems for resource monitoring, decision making under uncertainty, systems analyses, and hydro-meteorological forecast and warning with the National Water Information System to be strengthened for this purposes. Taking into account, the expected impact of climate change, the strategy will also set a base for incentivizing investments in innovative technologies aimed at enhancing productivity, conserving and protecting resources. The strategy will strengthen a base for further development of river basin plans and link this process with actual issuing of water use permits and monitoring of water use.
The process will be led by the MEWR, as a main Government entity responsible for coordination of the broader Water Sector Reform Program. A National Water Council will be established for overseeing implementation of the NWRS. The strategy will be developed in coordination with stakeholders and with their inputs.","The adoption and implementation of the National Water Resources Strategy in the country will accelerate the achievement of the SDG 6.5, which ""aims to implement integrated water resources management (IWRM)"". This will require the methodology to focus on interlinkages between surface and underground water resources, and also amplifying the role of natural and man-made storage for WRM. 
At the same time would contribute to SDG6.1 ""universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all"" by strengthening information base for planning of water supply systems and monitoring their performance; SDG target 6.3 targeting improved water quality by reducing pollution; SDG 6.3 targeting protection and restoring water-related ecosystems, including mountains, forests, wetlands, rivers, aquifers and lakes. Improved management of river basins and regulation of multi-purpose water reservoirs embedded in the proposed National Water Resources strategy would contribute to achievement of water, food and energy security. This improved Water-Food-Energy Nexus will accelerate the achievement of related SDG2 (and hunger, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture) and SDG7 energy). The National Water Resources Strategy would also accelerate development of the Program for Irrigation and Land Reclamation and set targets for water and energy efficiency targets in the irrigation sector contributing towards the achievement of SDG 6.4. The Strategy also targets improving the institutional set-up for the sector through more effective and accountable institutions and in particular basin organizations (SDG16) and additional financial resources for developing countries to improve their record on IWRM at basin level, adhering to the sustainable policies (SDG17), and creating a reliable information base for IWRM (SDG 6.5).","Government Agencies, Regional and local administration

            A National Growth Plan for the Danish Water Sector.",The general public.,Denmark,Global,"Denmark is a world-class leader in water solutions (water supply, wastewater treatment, climate adaptation) and provides some of the most important water solutions benefitting environment, climate, and health. The Danish water sector ranks first in Europe in terms of water patents per capita and water technology exports per capita. Denmark also hosts several world leading water companies and has a strong ecosystem of SME's, research communities and authorities. Denmark is actively engaged in water activities around the world - directly through our companies, NGOs, partnerships, and bilateral development assistance - and indirectly through multilateral development assistance.

At the same time the world is facing a severe water crisis. The risk of wars, migration, epidemics, environmental and climate problems related to water challenges is steadily increasing. The problems are caused on one hand by climate change, population growth and inequality - on another hand by unmet needs of investments, renovations and modernization of existing water infrastructure. 

Therefore, Denmark’s leadership on water is needed more than ever, and we should use and further develop our leadership on water as a way of helping the World with upcoming “water crisis”. And the political set ambitions for Denmark’s deliverables on water are high e.g. For the year 2030: A doubling of export of Danish water technology - and a total net energy- and climate neutral water sector. 

However, Denmark’s leading position in water is under pressure. Measured in lever of export of water technology, and in terms of number of new water patents the trend is stagnation. Denmark is also increasingly challenged in solving domestic challenges to it’s water environment e.g. Persistant organic pollutants.

DI Water/the Danish Water Industries Federation therefore commits itself to the UN: To be working for a national growth plan for the Danish water sector. A plan focused at public initiatives framed in dialogue between private and public stakeholders. The initiatives can be new regulation, improved framework conditions, better coordination of initiatives and regulation, higher prioritization of water in public R&D spending, stronger water focus in EU and new international initiatives. In short: A 360 degrees inspection and action-oriented approach to keep Denmark as a role model regarding water!

Concrete initiatives are under way.

 ","If we succeed in launching a national growth plan for the Danish water sector, Denmark can continue developing world-class technology and know-how within the water area. Thereby Denmark will continue punching above over weight and making a great difference in solving one of the major challenges in years ahead: the water crisis.","Government, politicians, decision-makers, NGOs, companies, and the general public.",Goal 6,"6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b","Mon, 06/21/2021 - 12:00",,,1.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

For the areas with The country has made significant progress towards achieving the MDGs, but declaring success on SDG 6.1 and 6.2 requires substantial coordinated efforts in setting a vision for sector’s future development, strengthening regulation of quality, availability and reliability of services and enabling a conducive environment for high-impact investments and their sustainability. The survey indicated that access to piped drinking water supply systems is estimated at 40 percent, and to piped sewer systems to 15 percent; only 29 percent of the rural population has access to piped water supply. Around 15 percent of the population still relies on unimproved water supply sources, putting at risk improved health outcomes. Consequently, along with the increased access to water supply, safe management of sanitation services across the chain needs to be regularly monitored, including through observation of the wide-spread on-site services such as safe containment. First assumptions on the investment demand for certain sector development options based on service coverage to be achieved until 2030 show that in a basic scenario only an increase of the universal coverage of population with basic to safely-managed water supply services would cost around US$800 mln, while an increase of service coverage in sanitation from 15 % to 30 % would create investment costs of at least US$340 mln.
The Program shall include a prioritized investment plan targeting settlements with the highest density of population deprived of water supply and wastewater services.
Implementation
(i)	Finalize nationwide survey of water supply and sanitation conditions for settlements in the country;
(ii)	Finalize decisions on establishing an adequate policy-making, sector planning, monitoring and regulatory bodies following the principle of separation of these public functions from the service-delivery provision;
(iii)	Finalize investment plan for water supply and sanitation investments in prioritized settlements based on the agreed criteria considering availability of safe water sources, population size and density and feasibility of technical solutions;
(iv)	Adopt the National Program for Water Supply and Sanitation until 2030 and investment and financing plan for its implementation for 2023- 2026.
(v)	Establish a monitoring system for the sector to serve as a basis for technical and economic regulation.

The specific objective is to improve the process of wastewater treatment and, where it is possible, transform the treatment plants into ""green factories"" to allow the reuse of the treated wastewater for irrigation and industrial purposes. The quality of water resources has long been in a state of difficulty, aggravated in recent years by climate changes, the development of urban agglomerations with increasingly intense soil consumption and the presence of emerging pollutants, with related problems in safeguarding water resources and more generally of human health. The water systems have a high degree of obsolescence; in particular, the sewage and purification systems are often not adequate compared to European standards. The intervention aims at remedying and preventing deficiencies in the purification sewage sector in consideration of the infringement procedures in place, with a total budget of 600,000,000.00 euros. Goals - make the treatment of wastewater discharged into marine and inland waters more effective, also through technological innovation; - transform the treatment plants into ""green factories"", which allow the recovery of energy and sludge, and the reuse of the purified wastewater for irrigation and industrial purposes; - provide that waste water treatment systems has a net zero energy consumption or that the renewal of the complete waste water system results in a reduction of the average energy consumption of at least 10 %; - Overcome EU infringement procedures in the wastewater sector.

Consisting of 4 brackish or saline ‘saliñas’ or marsh areas and a former saliña that decades ago was converted into a constructed permanent freshwater marsh, the Bubaliplas, as part of the sewage treatment plant RWZI Bubali. Once a connected wetland system, the 5 marshes have over the century been reduced and separated by human development through road construction and an increasingly built environment. 
These low-lying marshes of Aruba buffer stormy seas, slow shoreline erosion and are an important part of the watershed, help mitigate flood damage by slowing and storing flood water, catching sediments and other pollutants before they reach the ocean. Marsh vegetation and microorganisms also use and filter excess nutrients for growth that can otherwise pollute surface water such as nitrogen and phosphorus from fertilizers. The constructed wetland Bubaliplas is part of the sewage treatment system RWZI Bubali that uses natural processes involving wetland vegetation, soils, and their associated microbial assemblages to improve water quality.
The saliñas support a highly specialized set of life adapted to saline conditions. Plants typically are salt-tolerant, while the marshes provide vital food and habitat for insects such as butterflies and dragonflies, reptiles such as lizards and the endemic santanero, mammals such as bats, juvenile fish, bivalves such as mussels and clams, and crustaceans such as fidler and land crabs, as well as offering shelter and nesting sites for resident and migratory species of birds. Two of the five wetlands, together comprising the Western Wetlands, are internationally recognized as Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) and Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs), namely Bubaliplas and Saliña Druif. The five saliñas of the Western Wetlands provide food and habitat to numerous species of fauna, and Bubali alone is home to some 205 species of birds. These and other natural values have resulted in the Western Wetlands being nominated to become Aruba’s second RAMSAR area.
Objective: Develop a comprehensive conservation plan for the Western Wetlands to enhance and protect the natural values, and work toward these as RAMSAR areas. The five distinct saliñas comprising the Western Wetlands will be developed through a comprehensive, multi-year project, including education (awareness) and recreation (sustainable nature experiences) as an integral part of conservation.
Purpose: to safeguard the protected wetland areas and adjoining marine environment, through prudent visitor, wetland and water(shed) management – safeguarding, conserving and enhancing the integrity, health and resilience of biodiversity and wetland ecosystem, and increasing the value of the tourist product through sustainable nature experiences – thereby contributing to the sustainable future of Aruba.","The Western Wetland and new RAMSAR areas addresses the triple emergencies of climate risks, loss of biodiversity and pollution by tackling these in holistic manner with a nature-based solution and interlinked with the new wastewater treatment facility of Aruba.","Ministry of Nature Aruba, Ministry of Infrastructure Aruba, Aruba National Park Foundation, Utilities N.V.

            At least 40% of withdrawal sources are equipped with meters",Resident population in Italy,Italy,Europe,"The continuous water crises, due to the scarcity and uneven distribution of resources, has important effects on agricultural production, particularly where constant irrigation is a necessary practice and an essential condition for competitive agriculture. To increase the capacity to deal with emergencies, it is essential to quantify the volumes used for irrigation to increase irrigation efficiency and encourage the use of non-conventional water to supplement conventional sources. These volumes are often estimated rather than measured.
Goals:
-	Improve the management of water resources and reduce losses;
-	Promote the measurement and monitoring of uses both on collective networks (through the installation of counters and remote control systems) and for self-supply uses (through a private license monitoring system) as a prerequisite to complete the introduction of water pricing policies based on water volumes for efficient use of water resources in agriculture;
-	Reduce illegal water withdrawals in rural areas;
-	Increase the resilience of the irrigated agro-ecosystem to extreme climatic events, with particular reference to drought events.
In order to achieve the indicated goals, infrastructural interventions on the irrigation networks and systems and on the related digitization and monitoring systems are envisaged, consisting of:
-	the conversion of irrigation systems towards more efficient systems;
-	the adaptation of distribution networks in order to reduce losses;
-	the installation of technologies for an efficient use of water resources, such as meters and remote control.
The project does not directly envisage interventions on the reuse of treated water but aims to support the mapping and identification of those WWTPs (Wastewater treatment plants)  which are suitable for the production of treated wastewater for agricultural uses or which are adaptable, with appropriate investments. This identification will take into account the characteristics of the WWTP but also the proximity to irrigable crops with treated wastewater and the required qualitative characteristics (in line with the new European regulation, which will enter into force in 2023). Downstream of this, the design and financing of targeted collective infrastructures for re-use can be envisaged, where feasible and convenient, based on the monitoring carried out. Finally, a monitoring system of Water Withdrawal Licenses (WAL) for private use, and their connection to the data base for collective use (SIGRIAN) will be promoted in the Regions and Public Administrations, with the aim of recording and monitoring the volumes used in self-supply and prevent illegal use of water (also thanks to the joint measurement of the volumes used on the collective distribution networks).
Overall, the proposed irrigation investments, by promoting an efficient use of water, allow for a greater and more constant availability of water for irrigation and are therefore configured as a measure of adaptation of the agricultural sector to climate change, increasing the resilience of the agro-ecosystem to drought events.","The measure contributes to the achievement of the following SDGs:
- 6.4, by substantially increasing water use efficiency in all sectors and ensuring sustainable supplies and supplies of drinking water, to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people affected by it;
- 11.4, strengthening efforts to protect and safeguard the natural heritage, in particular that linked to marine and inland waters;
- 12.2, contributing to sustainable water management;
- 13.1, strengthening resilience and adaptation to climate-related risks and natural disasters
The investments will be distributed over all the regions, based on a strategic assessment of the needs and the capacity of the final beneficiaries to implement the interventions in due time. It is estimated that around 45-50% of the resources are destined for the southern regions.","Water Utilities,

This commitment aims to advance transboundary water cooperation utilizing our strength as a global multistakeholder platform.  Specifically, it aims to achieve two key outcomes.
1.	GWP commits to support development of new transboundary agreements, commitments and arrangements.
2.	GWP commits to support strengthening and establishment of transboundary institutions.
This commitment will take several approaches including the following:
A.	Partnership approach:
GWP’s multistakeholder partnership model at regional level can be utilized to facilitate regional and transboundary level dialogues, as a way to establish trust and identify entry points for cooperation.
At regional level, GWP’s multistakeholder partnership advances cooperation through fostering regional multi-stakeholder dialogues. These actions follow successful  experiences from dialogues in Southeastern Europe, South Africa, and Central America, where ongoing dialogues are fostering  communities of practice of transboundary water stakeholders that initiated or advanced basin-level cooperation as well-developed regional policy agreements.
At the global level, GWP collaborates with key global partners particularly through the Transboundary Water Coalition, GEF IW:LEARN (Global Environment Facility’s International Waters Learning Exchange and Resource Network),   and the Water Convention whom GWP joins  forces with to accelerate cooperation and foster knowledge development and sharing.
B.	Fostering basin-level cooperation through projects
At transboundary basin level, GWP is committed to fostering basin-level cooperation. For example, GWP supports cooperation over the Drin basin, Mono river, Limpopo river, Volta basin, Buzi- Pungwe- Save Tri-Basin, Sava basin, North Western Sahara Aquifer, to name a few. 
C.	Capacity building and peer-to-peer learning
 Capacity building and peer-to-peer learning is another important mechanism to foster cooperation..  At the global level GWP acts as an international hub for knowledge and information sharing on transboundary water management through  the IWRM Toolbox and the Transboundary Water Knowledge Exchange Hub. The Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) on Governance for Transboundary Freshwater Security, and its highly interactive events, will serve as a global learning platform for practitioners in the field. GWP also aims to foster a number of transboundary water academies, building onto successful water governance and international water law training in Africa, Asia and Latin America.
D.	Promote integrated approach to transboundary water management: IWRM
GWP utilizes its competitive advantage of being a global network promoting IWRM to foster cooperation over shared waters.  These include a Water, Energy, Food, Ecosystem Nexus approach, ensuring that benefits from different sectors are maximized, and a holistic Source-to-Sea approach in managing basins. The inclusion of stakeholders, particularly those that tend to have less voices particularly youth and women, is important in this regard. GWP aims to promote the inclusion of gender and youth in transboundary water management and related decision-making processes.","Fostering transboundary cooperation contributes to a number of SDGs. It can reduce conflict over resources, leading to peace and stability locally among riparians and, hence, in the region and beyond. Efficient management of shared resources can also improve agricultural yield, industrial production as well as energy production, and can have direct environmental and biodiversity benefits. Fostering transboundary water cooperation also results in better preparedness towards climate risks. Adoption of a source to sea approach in basins and pollution reduction across transboundary river basins can improve ecosystem health both in rivers and connected sea/ocean, and also supports the health of populations dependent on rivers.
The expected impact that this commitment aims for includes:
•	New transboundary water agreements or arrangements adopted.
•	New transboundary water institutions established, and capacity of existing institutions improved.
•	Additional transboundary benefits achieved related to local water, energy, food and ecosystem objectives through integrated approaches, for example related to increased water efficiency for agricultural and food production over transboundary waters, hydropower production on transboundary water balanced with ecological integrity of the rives.
•	Source to sea considerations are included in transboundary water governance, and solutions are applied at scale producing positive impacts in the basin and at the connected sea/ocean.
•	Women and youth empowered to participate in transboundary water governance.
•	Transboundary investments increase, including due to enhanced cooperation as well as through utilisation of international climate financing, and private sector engagement where pertinent.
•	Conflicts minimized and regional security enhanced.","Governments, Transboundary basin organisations, Regional economic commissions, Regional seas bodies, members of transboundary water coalition, investment and donor communities.","Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 9, Goal 10, Goal 11, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 14, Goal 15, Goal 16, Goal 17","1.5, 2.4 , 5.5, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 9.a, 10.2, 11.5, 12.5, 13.3, 14.1, 15.1, 16.7, 17.16, 17.17","Wed, 03/01/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2030 - 12:00","Overall of GWP’s transboundary work https://www.gwp.org/en/we-act/themesprogrammes/Transboundary_Cooperatio…

It also aligns with programs to mitigate the impact of climate change on ecosystems and which encourage endogenous development models, integrating local communities in biodiversity management, through the creation of income-generating activities. The NIWRMP is the fundamental document for the management of the water resource in which the implementation methods of the various programs and sector policies are defined (AICS Addis Ababa has participated since May 2016 in the drafting of the document and has been Co-Chair since the same date of the Donor Government working group on Water Resources Management). It is also complementary to a wider group of initiatives that are implemented by the European Union and other member states (Netherlands, Denmark, Finland), within the framework of the Team Europe Initiative (TEI). The program is in harmony with the ""Guidelines for an action of the Italian Cooperation in the water sector"" (2015 and subsequent revisions), which underline the consistent and traditional commitment of Italy on the front both of the interventions aimed at guaranteeing the access to safe drinking water and sanitation and efforts to promote participatory management of water use in rural areas and water conservation. It is also consistent with the guidelines ""Gender equality empowerment of women"" which provides for the commitment to promote access to training for women and their active role in decision-making processes. This proposal arises from the experiences acquired by AICS, in collaboration with local institutions, through the implementation of the Program for Drought Resilience and Food Security, in 4 Woreda of the Afar Region and from a consolidated knowledge of the WASH sector and foreseen at national level by the Climate Resilient WASH approach which have guided the last few years of sector activity and the implementation of numerous initiatives aimed at increasing access to safe and continuous water in rural and urban §12 contexts.

The objective of the project is to significantly reduce losses of drinking water by upgrading and modernizing water distribution networks through advanced control systems that allow monitoring of the main nodes and the most sensitive points of the network.
The Italian situation is characterized by a fragmented and inefficient management of water resources, by an antiquated distribution network (35 per cent of the pipelines are between 31 and 50 years old) and by the scarce effectiveness and industrial capacity of the actors involved in the water sector, especially in the South. This framework determines a high level of water dispersion: in distribution for civil use, the average loss is 40 %, with peaks exceeding 50 % in the south of the country.
The project aims at upgrading 25 drinking water networks, digitizing them and transforming them into an ""intelligent network"" that favours the optimal management of water resources, reducing losses and waste. The advanced control systems will allow the monitoring of flow rates, operating pressures and water quality parameters not only of the main nodes, but also of the sensitive points of the network.
The investment pursues the following objectives:
-	Obtain a reduction of losses in drinking water networks;
-	Increasing the resilience of water systems to climate change;
-	Strengthen the digitization of networks, to be transformed into an ""intelligent network"", to
        promote optimal management of water resources, reduce waste and limit inefficiencies.","At least 40% of the available resources of the measure must be allocated in the southern regions (Abruzzo, Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Molise, Puglia, Sardinia, Sicily).

Goals:
- Security of the water supply of important urban areas and/or large irrigated areas;
- Adjustment and maintenance of the safety of structural works;
- Greater resilience of infrastructures, also with a view to adapting to ongoing climate change;
- Recovery and increase of the useful transport capacity, with consequent economic repercussions, and improvement of the quality of the water resource.
The objectives indicated are achieved through investments in extraordinary maintenance and in the upgrading and/or completion of the derivation, storage and primary supply infrastructures.
The interventions concern the entire national territory, with different aims depending on the geographical area. In particular:
- the completion of large unfinished plants mainly in the south;
- extraordinary maintenance interventions aimed at making static and seismic safety and greater efficiency in large irrigation systems or for multiple purposes, especially in the centre-north;
- interventions on strategic works, which have also been operational for over 60-80 years, and the related interconnections, to make them more resilient, throughout the territory;
Implementation:
The program is in continuity of objectives and contents with the National Plan of interventions in the water sector (with particular reference to the ""Reservoirs"" section and to interventions on large drinking water aqueducts in the ""Aqueducts"" section).
Investments are distributed over all Italian regions.
To guarantee the completion of the projects within the foreseen timescale, interventions with defined and clear design profiles are selected, proposed by subjects with proven spending capacity and without particular uncertainties in the authorization and possibly expropriation phases. MIT and ARERA carry out constant monitoring of projects and works.
The intervention selection procedure has already been launched by MIT, since September 2020, together with the preliminary activity relating to the National Plan of interventions in the water sector.
The investments will be distributed over all the regions, based on a strategic assessment of the needs and the capacity of the final beneficiaries to implement the interventions in due time.

On both a global level, as well as national and regional levels across seven countries (Tunisia, Kenya, Zambia, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Indonesia). The program is implemented by four strong Southern CSOs; Akina Mama wa Afrika (AMwA), Fundación Avina, Slum Dwellers International (SDI) and SouthSouthNorth (SSN) ,and two Global CSOs; Hivos and WWF-Netherlands. VCA is funded under the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs’ five-year strategic partnership: “Power of Voices”. The VCA alliance works to amplify local climate solutions that increase resilience of communities and nature. It does this through advocating for meaningful inclusion and representation of local voices in global policy, pushing for the integration of the Locally Led Adaptation Principles into financing, policy and project design processes.

VCA's strength is to facilitate new unexpected coalitions that protect and expand civic space and engage in inclusive dialogue that builds mutual trust. In doing so, VCA shifts ownership to local civil society and support them in movement building, raising their voice to the global level and challenging power balances VCA contributes specifically to achieving water-related SDGs in the following ways;

Firstly, it aims to strengthen communities that struggle for access to safe drinking water and sanitation on a daily basis. By supporting and connecting local CSOs that work on these issues within their communities, they are capacitated to implement and scale up initiatives that are locally led, inclusive and reach even the most marginalized. Examples include locally led nature-based solutions, integrated water management, climate smart agriculture, community led urban water management, capacity building in water harvesting technologies and water conservation strategies as well as strengthening knowledge on WASH Rights and participation of (Indigenous) communities in national and regional water tables.

Secondly, VCA is committed to listen deeply to the voices of the people and communities we work with. By connecting the lived experiences and extensive contextual knowledge of local communities with the expertise of water sector stakeholders, VCA believes that global challenges in achieving climate and environmental justice can be overcome.","Local & Regional

Through locally designed and led solutions, communities will have increased access to safe drinking water and sanitation services. Securing this access is crucial in eradicating poverty in many of the remote as well as urban areas where organizations connected to VCA work. Secured access to drinking water and sanitation also is integral to the empowerment of women, girls and youth. By securing water to their communities, the work of the many local CSOs supported by VCA contributes to SDG 1, 3, 5, and 6.

VCA amplifies those solutions that work with nature or are at least safeguarding a healthy environment. Ensuring resilient hydrological cycles in e.g. Lukanga Swamps in Zambia, or in the forests of the Chaco-Pantanal in Paraguay will not only make local communities more resilient to climatic changes but will also have extended effects in wider connected ecological systems. Therefore, such an integrated approach contributes to SDG 13, and 15.

Currently, the VCA connects over 170+ CSOs across local, regional and global levels, fostering unusual partnerships and Multi-stakeholder collaborations. Through these networks, CSOs and activists are better connected, standing stronger in collective advocacy actions. Through the VCA program inclusion of of Indigenous, youth, women and other marginalized group representatives in local decision making on water management has improved in the regions where we work. Working through local decision-making platforms can also affect national policies. In addition, through capacity strengthening and outreach on (land, WASH) - rights communities are increasingly able to hold governments and other stakeholders accountable, leading to more inclusive policies, and expanded civic space. (This also contributes to SDG 10)

On a global scale; the local impacts and stories of success will influence better informed and inclusive global policies on water management, regulation and access. Safeguarding water as a human right. Evidence emerging from the local VCA sites will prove the effectiveness and moral justification of the Locally Led Adaptation principles.

The outputs are meant to be used to improve the menstrual health of adolescent girls and young women.",Global,Global,"Rationale:
1.	A growing number of countries are developing policies and strategies on universal health coverage (UHC). Within this, WHO’s Department of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research is working to ensure that the full range of sexual and reproductive health issues is addressed. This includes menstrual health.
2.	There is growing interest and experience in addressing the menstrual health of adolescents, however this is still largely focused on informing and preparing adolescents for menarche, and for providing them with products.
3.	In most countries, ministries of health are not really engaging in/contributing to menstrual health programmes. This means that case management of menstrual health problems in not really addressed.
Objectives:
1. To advocate with for the inclusion of menstrual health promotion, care, and support, and links to adequate water supply and sanitation, in the context of universal health coverage. While the initial focus will be on adolescents, this will extend overtime to the life course.
2.	To work with partners to generate data and develop/update tools to promote menstrual health in the context of UHC and support countries in operationalizing it.
3.	To support countries in using these tools to integrate menstrual health into UHC.
Proposed approaches:
In relation to objective 1: WHO will work with UNFPA and the Global Menstrual Health Collective to advocate for this.
In relation to objective 2: WHO will work with individuals and organizations involved in strengthening data on adolescent health, those involved in the case management of menstrual health problems and those involved in health systems strengthening work to synthesize available data, develop/update evidence-based case management tools, and set out approaches to integrate menstrual health into health and related systems.
In relation to objective 3: WHO will work with UNFPA and headquarters, regional office and country office levels to use opportunities to support country level decision making on UHC to include menstrual health.","In relation to objective 1:  (i) A shared understanding in the UHC community about the importance of including SRH and specifically menstrual health within this. (ii) Awareness of WHO’s programme support tools.
In relation to objective 2: A set of programme support tools on integrating menstrual health in UHC.
In relation to objective 3: Support to 10 countries to integrate menstrual health in health systems. 
Our vision is that women and girls and other people who menstruate, have access to information and education about it; to the menstrual products they need;  water, sanitation, and disposal facilities; to competent and empathic care when needed; to live, study and work in an environment in which menstruation is seen as positive and healthy not something to be ashamed of; and to fully participate in work and social activities. Thirdly, to ensure that these activities are included in the relevant sectoral work plans and budgets, and their performance is measured.","UN agencies (UNFPA, UNICEF and UNESCO), Partnerships (Global Menstrual Health Collective), Academics (Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University)","Goal 3, Goal 5, Goal 6","3.7 , 3.8, 5.5, 5.6, 6.2","Wed, 03/01/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2024 - 12:00","https://www.who.int/news/item/22-06-2022-who-statement-on-menstrual-hea…
Menstrual Health was not on the agenda of the International Conference on the Population and Development or the Millennium Declaration. Nor it is explicitly stated in the Sustainable Development Goals targets for goals 3, 5 or 6. However, it has been placed on the global health, education, human rights, and gender equality/equity agendas by grass-roots workers and activists from the global South, drawing attention to reports of women’s and girls’ experiences of shame and embarrassment, and the barriers they face in managing their period because they do not have the means to do so, with consequences for their life opportunities including their rights to education, work, water and sanitation, non-discrimination and gender equality – and ultimately to health. 
WHO calls for three actions. Firstly, to recognize and frame menstruation as a health issue, not a hygiene issue – a health issue with physical, psychological, and social dimensions, and one that needs to be addressed in the perspective of a life course – from before menarche to after menopause. Secondly, to recognize that menstrual health means that women and girls and other people who menstruate, have access to information and education about it; to the menstrual products they need;  water, sanitation, and disposal facilities; to competent and empathic care when needed; to live, study and work in an environment in which menstruation is seen as positive and healthy not something to be ashamed of; and to fully participate in work and social activities. Thirdly, to ensure that these activities are included in the relevant sectoral work plans and budgets, and their performance is measured. 
WHO recognizes that several sectors have equally important roles to play in promoting and safeguarding Menstrual Health and is committed to stepping up its efforts to encourage health policymakers and programme managers to engage with these sectors to promote the rights of women, girls and other people who menstruate and meet their comprehensive menstrual health needs, especially in humanitarian contexts. WHO is also committed to breaking the silence and stigma associated with menstruation and to make schools, health facilities and other workplaces (including WHO’s workplaces), menstruation responsive.
Activists – including young people - and nongovernmental organizations have done much to place menstrual health on the agenda. A growing number of governments are taking action. Finally, a handful of countries have put in place laws and policies for medical leave when one is experiencing pain, discomfort and other symptoms and signs related to menstruation. These are useful steps, but governments could and should do more than improve access to menstrual products. They should make schools, workplaces and public institutions supportive of managing menstruation with comfort and dignity. More importantly, they should normalize menstruation and break the silence around it. Finally, in the context of what is happening in Ethiopia, Ukraine, and elsewhere, governments should include an attention to menstruation as part of a broader Sexual and Reproductive Health response in those who are displaced because of war or natural calamities.",0.125,0.2222222222222222,0.6666666666666666,0.25,0.0,0.05494505494505515

The capacity to monitor and manage water resources is fragmented and inadequate. WMO and partners endeavor to improve global water information through a Hydrological Status and Outlook System (HydroSOS) and an annual State of Global Water Resources Report. 
The initiative will (1) enhance the capacities of countries to produce hydrological status assessments and outlooks at seasonal to sub-seasonal scale; (2) integrate such products for policy and decision-making at the national, regional, and global level; and (3) release a yearly global report presenting an overall status of the water resources.  Member States, Decision-makers and Stakeholders will be able to respond to questions, such as: “How much water is available in my basin or region at the moment?”; ""Is the current situation normal or significantly above/below normal conditions?""; and ""How might the local and regional flood/drought situation change in the coming weeks to months?”. 
The initiative focuses on implementing HydroSOS at various scales (regional, national and global)  by assessing existing capacities, further developing those capacities and technical applications, and establishing WMO HydroSOS Centers embedded within the WMO Integrated Processing and Prediction System (WIPPS). HydroSOS aspires to build a sustainable and robust global framework for hydrological status and outlook information which is centered on locally produced analysis, supplemented by products from global hydrological models and data centers. HydroSOS portals will ensure the products are open and accessible for WMO Members and other stakeholders. 
The first global report was launched in 2022 which gave an overall picture of the water resources, changes in hydrological storages (groundwater, snow and ice) and major hydrological extreme events and associated losses. The report provided hydrological information to enhance, guide and support water-related decision-making by planners, managers, and policymakers at all levels of government. Once HydroSOS is operational, the Annual State of Water Resources report will present information derived from  HydroSOS and serve as a summary of information to guide policy development, climate change mitigation, and adaptation action. 
The governance is overseen by the two technical commissions of WMO and is coordinated by the Hydrological Coordination Panel. The work streams are divided into Technical Development, Implementation, and Coordination, constituted by teams of experts from partners and WMO staff. HydroSOS implementation is also supported by  the other WMO activities like the HydroHub (focusing on innovation to increase capacities of Member states), and WHOS (WMO Hydrological Observing System which works as a broker for effective data/information transfer)
The HydroSOS and the State of Global Water Resources report are elements included in the WMO Plan of Action for Water based on a decadal Vision and Strategy for Hydrology with eight Ambitions that support the operational hydrological community.  Specifically, “By 2030 a cooperative global community is successfully addressing the growing challenges related to hydrological extremes, water availability and quality, and food security, by advancing operational hydrology through enhanced science, infrastructure, capacity-building and related services, in the context of sustainable development and enhanced resilience.”","WMO’s objective is to help us, and future generations to understand better how water availability and the frequency of floods and droughts respond to the changing climate and anthropogenic activities and the resulting impact on the water-energy-food-ecosystem nexus (SDG 6, 2, 7, 11, 13, and 15).
HydroSOS is currently being implemented at global, regional, and national/local scales. Over three years, it is expected that HydroSOS will be functional and share the hydrological status of at least 50 countries and the hydrological outlooks of at least 20 countries. Complementing HydroSOS, the annual State of Water Resources report is fed by the information from countries participating in HydroSOS,  helping to reduce the gaps in information at the global scale by taking action at the national/regional scales. 
Several socioeconomic sectors, if not all, depend on water. Making hydrological information available is the first step to empower stakeholders to make informed decisions.  HydroSOS will inform planning, decision and policy-making, addressing current gaps in the availability of water information. Understanding water resource availability allows better planning and support for safe drinking water and sanitation (SDG 6) and informs impacts on people (SDG 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), industries (SDG 9), and the environment (SDG 14 and 15). Providing baselines and projections on changes to water resources, also informs mitigation and adaptation to climate change and its impacts on society (SDG 13), as well as potential security issues (SDG 16). HydroSOS empowers national and international water management and catalyzes international cooperation through trusted water data, assessments, and outlooks.
Improved global water information through HydroSOS will accelerate the implementation of the SDGs by fostering international and regional cooperation among countries and ministries (SDG 17). Shared information products will support decision-makers and river basin-wide collaboration. National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) will support ministries of environment, water, climate change, transport, etc., by providing timely information on the state of their water resources. This will further provide an integrated regional/global overview of the resource to assist the aid & development sector, NGOs and UN entities in their anticipatory action and response to water-related hazards (SDG 11.5). The HydroSOS framework is an enabler for establishing Early Warning for all (EW4ALL) by strengthening the monitoring and forecasting capacities for floods and droughts of the Members through various implementation levels.
Finally, better water data and information is paramount in guiding intergovernmental discussions regarding shared water resources. This initiative underscores the integral role of Member States in achieving this and strongly encourages Members to strengthen their monitoring network for timely data collection of the various components of the water cycle – groundwater, soil moisture, streamflow and snow and ice, etc. – to share the data obtained under the WMO Unified Data Policy encouraging open data and knowledge.","The Global Hydrological Status and Outlook System (HydroSOS) is being implemented through collaboration with different partners, including National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) and affiliated water departments, transboundary basin organizations, research organizations, and with consultations with stakeholders from various sectors, including agriculture, energy, disaster risk reduction (DRR), dam operators, etc.

Also the Malta archipelago, which is geologically connected of the south of Sicily in southern Italy, has been place of (much lesser) exploration and drilling activities. Some of these wells, in both Sicily and Malta, have revealed indications of deep fresh to low-salinity groundwater.
The University of Malta, through a research group and funded research programs (e.g. Marie-Curies, PhDs grants),  have committed to analyze a wide dataset of Oil&Gas wells and seismic reflection data in order to characterize deep groundwater in terms of salinity, pressure and 3D distribution at regional scale, by applying a combination of well-established concepts from oil and gas exploration, reservoir engineering, geophysics, hydrogeology and marine geology.
The objective will be to: i) characterize the geometry, extension and volume of these potentially extensive deep fresh/low-salinity  groundwater hosted in deep reservoirs; ii) explore implications, as an unconventional source of water, to the many other Mediterranean countries, of which coastal areas shared a common geological history; iii) run a feasibility study for the potential development of these deep water resources, evaluating how easily and at which costs the existing technology used in Oil & Gas exploration and production industry could be transferred.","The discovery and evaluation of potential deep preserved groundwater in the study area and their scientific understanding, can be quite immediately extended and applied especially to the numerous water scarce areas along the Mediterranean coastlines (e.g. Malta, Cipro, Greece, Morocco, Tunisia, Egypt, Lebanon and Turkey), allowing to evaluate its use as a future source of water for many different purposes, including potable water supply of the population, cattle-breeding farms, industrial water supply, irrigation, etc.","Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia (INGV)

Initiated by the Dutch Expertgroep Circular Water of the Dutch Water Alliance. The kick off is on Wednesday 22nd March - World Water Day - launching its first publication: a 'BLUEPRINT FOR A CIRCULAR WATER SMART SOCIETY' with tangible solutions for the practical implementation of circular water and a vision of water uses within the urban environment. This Blueprint for a Circular, Water-Smart Society aims to provide a concise overview of circular water solutions that can be safely deployed in the short term to reduce tap water use. This blueprint provides an overview of the causes of the current water crisis and how the use of safe circular water sources in the urban environment is a quick-to-implement and smart solution to reduce tap water use and wastewater emissions by 20% to 45%. Circular water can be applied without requiring residents to make concessions in their standard of living. On the contrary, even during long periods of drought and water scarcity, normal pre-water-scarcity living standards can be maintained while saving water and energy.","We stand at a crossroads to raise ambition and accelerate action to tackle the global water crisis. We need to transition from linear to circular water management. As we strive to create a more sustainable future, innovative solutions are emerging in various industries, including water conservation. 
Circular water substantially reduces water uptake, wastewater emissions, carbon footprint, energy consumption, and reduces water and energy bills. It enables higher density building, needs less infrastructure and with increased water pricing offers end-users and communities more resilience and empowers home owners to create their own sustainable environment. Furthermore, NextGen IoT-connected circular water solution devices offer invaluable data to water utilities, as well as education on the value of water and awareness for its end users.
Impact:
1. Discourage and eventually ban the use of tap water for non-potable purposes in the shortest possible time, starting with new construction and renovation
2. Encourage and eventually mandate the use of alternative circular water sources in the broadest sense;
3. Ensure the livability of cities by deploying smart, efficient and safe alternative circular water sources for watering gardens, green roofs and green walls, and to prohibit the use of tap water for these applications;
4. Urgently adjust regulations and building codes;
5. Accelerate the implementation of existing standards for safe circular water use or expand existing standards with sections on safe circular water use. If standards for safe circular water use are not yet available, governments could speed up the introduction of standards and cooperate with existing standards organizations such as NSF or European organizations;
6. Safeguard public health and make circular water available at a lower cost than tap water by applying fit-for-purpose circular water quality criteria;
7. Encourage public-private collaboration among water sector stakeholders to enable them to play a leading role in the transformation to a Water-Smart Society.
Impact on UNSDGs: water impacts ALL UNSDGs, but specifically we have chosen the following to be strongly impacted in positive sense:

This movement we have started with the aim of water literacy among the villagers and increase the groundwater level. The Bhujal Abhiyan movement is a sustainable water movement because there is 100% participation of villagers in the water conservation work. We are working in the cluster of 34 villages with the aim of making drought-free and environment-friendly villages in the coming 5 years. The technique of our work- 1. Capacity building of water committee through Training and workshops- First we take the gram sabha in the villages and form a Bhujal Paani Samiti (Water committee).In each committee there are 6 to 10 people (men/women), we called this volunteer Bhujal Warkari. One main member of the committee we called it “Bhujal Dindi Pramukh” We conduct water literacy sessions and awareness for the Bhujal Paani samiti and make them educate to understand the importance of water. Once all the training of the Bhujal water committee is done, under the guidance of a geologist, we understand the watershed. 2. Understanding the watershed of the village through field visits - Under the guidance of a Geologist, the Bhujal water committee does a field survey to understand the watershed of the village, also for data collection and rough budget estimate. 3. Data Collection-Actual detailed survey for data collection with the help of Geologists and technical person guidance. Mapping and analysis of data collected for water budgeting and planning future works. 4. Water budget and Water Security Plan presentation -Once all the plan is ready, Bhujal Dindi Pramukh and Bhujal Paani samiti take a village meeting and present the water budget and water security plan to villagers. Here all the villagers finalized the Implementation of conservation structures. 5. Actual Interventions -From CSR/NGO we provide excavator machines and villagers take the responsibility for fuel and we provide all the technical guidance to them Impact of our work – We have rejuvenated 11 lakes and created other water conservation work which creates a 5000 million water storage capacity and we are improving the quality of soil by doing compartment bunding work in the villages. 1. People participation is increasing in the 34 villages where we are working. 2. In 34 villages around 50000 farmers are benefiting from water conservation work. 3. Farmers' income per year per acre has been increased to Rs. 10000 to Rs. 20000 4. Milk animal count is increasing in the villages so the milk produced capacity is increasing. 5. Crop management planning is coming into a reality. We are conducting to promote Horticulture farming. 6. Nurturing indigenous 25000 trees in 4 villages. 7. Animals are getting water in the lakes- when there is no water in 5 km radius- under our concept “1 Village 1 Village”, animals will surely gets the water to drink. 8. In 11 villages we have almost solved the drinking water problem to 60 %.","If we see all 17 SDG's we can say that one important root to achieving all other SDG's ""Water & Soil"". With this aim, for the last 6 years, we are working on 2 things. The new SDG will create water literacy for self-sustainable water development. Also, it will increase people's participation which is like capacity building. I feel if we need to achieve all 17 SDGs then we need to empower the people and that is only possible when we create awareness and start implementing those. A lot of people are doing work on water conservation, and climate change control but their work did not get recognized.

It urged for a joint commitment and a proactive approach among governments, scientists and practitioners, especially in deltas, coastal areas and small islands, to develop an integrated systems approach to adaptation and resilience building. In response to that call, the Netherlands Ministry of Infrastructure and Water management, supported in its founding phase by Deltares, the Global Center on Adaptation and the Delta Alliance have joined forces to launch the ‘International Panel for Deltas, Coastal Areas and Islands’ (IPDC) with policymakers, academics, investors and practitioners worldwide. By connecting multiple layers of policy and decision-making, financing, knowledge development and practice, the IPDC aims to leverage the power of multi-actor collaboration. To facilitate this, the IPDC visions and activities stand on a three-layered approach: The policy and finance layer: the champions group consists of high-level leaders for political and financial commitment and leadership. The science layer: the science panel consists of top-level scientists and adaptation experts linking shared knowledge to local planning and implementation needs. The implementation layer: the action holders consists of knowledge networks and implementation agencies working with local and international experts to support accelerated actions on the ground.

The climate crisis is inflaming extremism and instability in the most water-scarce region on the planet. Without global leadership and meaningful action, millions of people will lose their livelihoods and could become climate refugees. An international coalition of governments, a ‘coalition of the willing,’ is needed to help bring together the Jordanian, Palestinian, and Israeli governments to create shared climate-smart solutions.
The call of EcoPeace Middle East is to advance a Green Blue Deal based on 4 pillars:
Jordanian/Palestinian/Israeli cooperation to improve adaptive capacities on water and renewable energy security by creating a water and renewable energy exchange
Advancing Israeli/Palestinian natural water reallocations and water management
Rehabilitating the Jordan River and its once rich biodiversity through investments in region-wide climate-smart initiatives and creation of green jobs

In the words of Dr Martin Luther King, Jr.: “One day our society will come to respect the sanitation worker if it is to survive, for the person who picks up our garbage, in the final analysis, is as significant as the physician, for if he [she] doesn't do his job, diseases are rampant.” March 18, 1968, Memphis, TN.","Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan, Global Action Plan, Zambia","Africa, Asia and Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean","UN-Water dedicated its World Water Day and World Toilet Day campaigns in 2016 to the links between Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and jobs, underscoring the many elements linking SDGs 6 and 8.  The working conditions, skills and formalization of those working for WASH were central to these campaigns.  Since then, these linkages have been incorporated into the work of UN-Water.
The sanitation workforce dedicated to faecal sludge management bridges the gap between sanitation infrastructure and the provision of sanitation services. Sanitation workers provide an essential public service but often at the cost of their dignity, safety, health, and living conditions. They are some of the most vulnerable workers. They are far too often invisible, unquantified, and ostracized, and many of the challenges they face stem from this fundamental lack of acknowledgement. Sanitation workers are exposed to serious occupational and environmental health hazards risking illness, injury, and death.
Frequently hailing from marginalized, low-income, class, caste backgrounds or religious minorities, the priorities and concerns of sanitary workers, especially those involved in the hazardous removal of human waste, remain not only overlooked but are unseen by decision-makers, and the wider society.
Sanitation workers range from permanent public or private employees with health benefits, pensions, and clear legal protections to some of the most marginalized, poor, and abused members of society who take on low-grade, labour-intensive, and dangerous work. For those employed informally, their work is financially precarious, with poor pay and few benefits. Sanitation workers often suffer weak legal protection, missing or weak standard operating procedures and weak enforcement and oversight of laws and policies protecting their rights and health.
Ensuring the fundamental principles and rights at work and improving the working conditions of sanitation workers is a key contribution to SDG 6 and SDG 8. Better conditions for water workers will improve water and sanitation services, making clean water provision and sanitation not only a path towards water access but also to employment and business growth.
The Initiative for Sanitation Workers led by the ILO and its partners launched an initial assessment of the working conditions of sanitation workers in 2019. Titled “Health, Safety and Dignity of Sanitation Workers”, the assessment called for the promotion of ILO instruments on OSH, freedom of association and the formalization of sanitation workers. As a result, the ILO organized a workshop on the working conditions of sanitation workers in South Asia, which concluded with the adoption of dedicated strategies to address the decent work deficits of sanitation workers.  Currently, the ILO is developing projects in several countries including India and Pakistan.
Commitment: A research and advocacy campaign in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to promote decent work, skills and knowledge development as well as improve the working conditions of sanitation workers.","Designed with an explicit pro-poor focus that seeks to eradicate extreme poverty, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development promises to “leave no one behind”. A focus on sanitation workers and decent jobs in the WASH sector would support the main foundation of the 2030 Agenda. Implemented at the local level, the commitment targets the workers who are most at risk of being left behind. The actions will help accelerate the implementation of SDG 6, 8, and 11, particularly targets 6.1, 6.2, 6.a, and 6.b; 8.3, 8.7, and 8.8; 11.5, and 11.6 respectively through improved awareness of existing decent work deficits; recognition, organization, and formalization of sanitation work and workers; application of the fundamental principles and rights at work, national labour laws, and occupational safety and health (OSH) principles to sanitation workers and the WASH sector; regular engagement with social partners to promote social dialogue; the promotion of decent jobs creation in the WASH sector; and the upskilling, and reskilling of sanitation workers.","World Health Organization (WHO)

Every child has the right to live in a safe and sustainable climate and environment. And yet, climate change, weak local and national governance, unplanned urbanization and insufficient awareness of the dangers posed by environmental risks – including inadequate water and sanitation systems – expose millions of children to potential harm. UNICEF’s work in 2022–2025 will help to achieve these high-level results, among others: Increase the  population using safely managed drinking water services and the population using safely managed sanitation services. Contribute to decrease the under-5 mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, sanitation and hygiene.
To ensure every child lives in a safe and sustainable climate and environment, UNICEF works in these result areas:
Safe and equitable water, sanitation and hygiene services and practices: Safe water, clean toilets and soap can prevent disease and save children’s lives. But for millions, these necessities are out of reach. UNICEF establishes sustainable water and sanitation services for the long-term. And we provide vital hygiene supplies, such as soap and menstrual hygiene products.
Water, sanitation and hygiene systems and empowerment of communities: UNICEF strengthens water, sanitation and hygiene systems, such as handwashing facilities and toilets, in schools, communities and health centres. But our work also focuses on community empowerment to ensure everyone practices good hygiene and understands the dangers of unclean water and poor sanitation.
UNICEF reaffirm our commitment to our expanded work on WASH system strengthening supporting national WASH financing strategies and increased WASH sector fund leveraging, sustainability and also top support the development of climate  rationales for the impact of climate change and water scarcity  on WASH services. In order to implement these targets, UNICEF and partners have developed the Sanitation Game Plan Initiative and the Water Security for All initiative to reach the children living in areas of high or extremely high water vulnerability.","UNICEF's work on water and climate is reflected in Goal Area 4 aimed at ensuring that every child, including adolescents, uses safe and equitable WASH services and lives in a safe and sustainable climate and environment. Work under this Goal Area, including in humanitarian crises and fragile contexts, contributes to health, education, nutrition, environmental, resilience and gender components of the 2030 Agenda, including Sustainable Development Goals 5, 6, 7, 8, 12 and 13, and is linked to sustainable progress in numerous other Sustainable Development Goals, including Goals 2,3 and 4 and contributing to Goals 1,16, 17","In 2021, UNICEF country offices reported a total of 1,792 WASH programme partners – in addition to government partners.

The initiative is part of the interventions of the PNRR - National Recovery and Resilience Plan, where, to Component 4 (C4 - Protection of the territory and water resources) of ""Mission 2"" (M2 - Green Revolution and Ecological Transition) 15.05 billion euros are assigned for coordinated actions that will make the country more resilient to the impacts of climate change and human pressure, protecting natural resources, the territory and biodiversity.
The actions are defined through investments and reforms to be implemented according to the existing deadlines. In this context, the measure 1 (M2C4.1) aims to strengthen the forecasting capacity of the effects of climate change through the investment I1.1, which amounts to 500 million euros.
The objective of Investment I1.1 is to develop an advanced and integrated monitoring and forecasting system for the identification of hydrological/water-related risks (SIM), to which the territory, infrastructures and natural resources may be prone as a result of climate change and/or inadequate territorial planning. It is an integrated surveillance/monitoring system, from real time to the long term, to implement both preventive measures (planned maintenance of the territory and maintenance/modernization of infrastructures), and interventions aimed at preventing the illegal waste management, fires, optimizing the use of resources and emergency management. A specific Operational Work Plan (POL) identifies the 4 Components into which the monitoring system have to be structured and implemented (1. Aerospace remote sensing and on-site sensors; 2. Telecommunications system; 3. Analysis and control rooms; 4. IT security systems and services) and the specific intervention topics (vertical applications) to which the components of the system have to apply: Hydrogeological instability monitoring; Precision agriculture; Marine and coastal pollution monitoring; Identification of environmental crimes; Emergency support (natural disasters); forest and interface fires. For each vertical application, the application contents are described and the Central Administrations, Agencies and State Bodies/Departments are identified, whose direct involvement is envisaged, in support of MASE, in the planning and implementation phase of the Monitoring System.
Involvement takes place through participation in inter-institutional technical working groups set up for each of the vertical applications of the System. The POL is also accompanied by an initial strategic scheme of actions necessary to achieve the investment objectives which, for each action, identifies: objectives, resources (i.e., supporting administrations involved), expected impact, timing of the action.","At the end of the project, all the institutions involved in the integrated management, protection and sustainable use of water, forests and territory, in the mitigation of the risk of drought, floods, landslides, fires and emergencies, will be able to use/share the information and data deriving from monitoring (interoperability of monitoring systems at different scales) as well as the modeling made available on the platform in order to be able to prevent, effectively and in an integrated manner and mitigate the water-related risks.
This system will be the basis of a real integrated and adaptive management of resources and infrastructures, allowing to make forecasts, to know in real time the circulation and consistency of water resources, to deal with environmental emergencies or to feed early warning services in case of certain types of events.
Through SIM will be possible to achieve various targets of the SDGs:
- integrated, sustainable and adaptive water management, availability and access to water in good quality and sufficient quantity (SDG 2.3, 3.3, 3.9, 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.8);
- the conservation, restoration and sustainable management of water-related terrestrial ecosystems (SDG 8.4, 15.1, 15.4, 15.5);
- better mitigation of drought and flood risks (SDG 11.3,11.4, 11.5, 13.3, 15.2), contrast to desertification and soil degradation (SDG 15.3)
- strengthening resilience and capacity to adapt to the impacts of climate change (SDG 1.5, 2.4, 11.b, 13.1,13.2,13.3)

Community of the Network of UNESCO MAB Biosphere Reserves present in the District",Italy,Europe,"The ""Renaturation of the Po area"" project is one of the most important commitments envisaged by the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR). It is an investment covering the entire river course, from which a great impact is expected for the improvement of the river ecosystem, safety and quality of life for those who live in the areas and tourists.
The morphological restoration and protection of biodiversity are the main issues addressed by the project which provides for ecological restoration and environmental restoration interventions, with the reactivation of oxbow lakes and abandoned branches and natural reforestation to consolidate and expand the present forests, for adjustment of the groins for navigation, which have become too high over the years, following the lowering of the river bed, to be overcome by the ordinary flow rates of the Po and for the containment of invasive alien plant species.
In summary, the project pursues the objective of reducing the artificiality of the riverbed, an issue closely linked to the European Strategy for biodiversity to 2030 which includes among its lines of action the restoration of freshwater ecosystems, thus contributing to the achievement of the objectives of Directive 2000/60/EC through the restoration of the ecosystem functionality of watercourses.
The project is, therefore, a river requalification project, divided into a series of ""integrated interventions to reduce hydrogeological risk and to improve the ecological status of waterways and protect ecosystems and biodiversity (...)"", and in implementation of the measures programmed by the Flood Risk Management Plan pursuant to Directive 2007/60/EC and by the Water Management Plan pursuant to Directive 2000/60/EC of the hydrographic district of the river Po.
At the same time, the planned interventions will contribute to the consolidation of the ecological-river corridor and to the improvement of the conservation status of species and habitats, in compliance with the significant areas of biodiversity present along the river branch, in the numerous ""Natura 2000 Network"" areas, established and protected in accordance with Directive 92/43/EEC (Habitats) and Directive 2009/147/EC (Birds), as transposed into national legislation.
Finally, in order to respond to the morphological rebalancing needs affecting the Po River branch, the interventions contribute to the implementation of the ""General program for the management of alluvial sediments of the Po riverbed"", prepared and adopted in 2008 by the MASE and by all the Regions of the river Po, in the Institutional Committee of the District Authority of the river Po.
The ""Renaturation of the Po area"" project consists of an Action Program divided into 56 intervention areas distributed along the entire Po River, down to its delta. The interventions are divided in to the following types:
Hydraulic - morphological interventions:
- Reduction of the artificial sectors of the riverbed (adaptation of navigation groins, decommissioning/modification of defense works);
- Reactivation and reopening of oxbow lakes and abandoned branches and opening of new river branches;
Environmental – naturalistic interventions:
- Redevelopment of oxbow lakes and abandoned branches;
- Naturalistic reforestation;
- Control of invasive alien vegetation species.","-	The realization of the interventions envisaged by the Renaturation Project will allow the Po River Basin District Authority and the Regions crossed by the river to implement a widespread action of environmental restoration and will represent the first step for a wider and important restoration ecology of our country, in line with the future implementation of the EU Regulation on the Nature Restoration Law. In particular, the project will allow to:
-	- conserve and restore fluvial and peri-fluvial ecosystems, through the recovery of the river bed and the lateral connection with the flood plain, also through solutions based on nature and green infrastructure. This will contribute to the reduction of the coastal populations' vulnerability to flooding and other climate-related natural disasters (SDG 13.1) and at the same time will allow for the reconstruction of the river ecological corridor which is currently fragmented (SDG 15.1, 15.5);
-	- redevelop and reactivate oxbow lakes and abandoned branches, allowing the protection and restoration of wetlands, the recovery of the naturalness of floodplains and riparian plant communities and halt the loss of biodiversity (SDG 6.6 15.1, 15.5);
-	- to reforest degraded areas, through the planting of native species and the fight against invasive alien plant species, helping to recreate a widespread naturalness of the floodplains and river areas and contributing to the strengthening of the Po River ecological corridor (SDG 15.2, 15.5, 15.8);
-	- restore natural habitats, recover ecosystems, also with the aim of tackling climate change, in response to the objectives set by the climate change adaptation strategy. The project contributes both in terms of climate change mitigation through forestation as a contribution in terms of decarbonization, and in terms of adaptation through the river connection, to have a more resilient river (SDG 13.1);
-	- favor the increase of ecosystem services, conferring direct benefits to satisfy the needs and requirements of the individuals and of the community which depend decisively on the healthiness of the environment and on the capacity of natural capital to support human life. They include: the production of food, the availability of water, of raw materials, of genetic resources, but also fundamental functions and processes such as the absorption of pollutants, protection from erosion, regulation of surface water flow, maintenance of water quality, disease control, soil formation and regeneration. The increase in the aforementioned ecosystem services will allow multiple benefits provided in the form of goods and services that guarantee the community to achieve and satisfy its well-being (SDG 6.3, 6.6, 13.1, 15.1, 15.2, 15.5);

In addition, during the next several years, IMI-SDG6 will provide more intensive support to approximately 50 countries to facilitate better monitoring, reporting and evidence-driven policy.",Global,Global,"The 2030 Agenda is an ambitious plan of action for “people, planet and prosperity”, and so is the dedicated goal on water and sanitation (SDG 6), which through its many interlinkages with other goals, will play a key role in realizing this Agenda. To ensure progress and strengthen accountability it is essential to set up solid mechanisms for policy-relevant monitoring and reporting. 
Through the UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6 (IMI-SDG6), the United Nations seeks to support countries in monitoring water- and sanitation-related issues within the framework of the 2030 Agenda and in compiling country data to report on global progress towards SDG 6.
The Initiative’s long-term goal is the acceleration of the achievement of SDG 6 through evidence-based policies, regulations, planning and investments. To do this, it aims to ensure that by 2030, increased availability and holistic analysis of high-quality data contributes to better informed water and sanitation policy, regulation, planning and investment at all levels. IMI-SDG6 is one of the few, if not the only, UN initiative providing significant resources and capacity to UN Member States to drive the evidence base for achieving Agenda 2030.
The voluntary commitment of IMI-SDG6 is as follows:
“The UN-Water Integrated Monitoring Initiative for SDG 6 will work with all UN Member States to ensure that by 2030, data on all SDG 6 global indicators is available for all countries, providing a robust basis for the analysis of gaps, and stimulating debate on needs and means of acceleration of the delivery of SDG 6 targets. This will also serve as an important means to support the follow-up and review of the outcomes of the 2023 UN Water Conference and country commitments under the Water Action Agenda.”","Between now and the end of the SDG period, three global data collection exercises will be undertaken by IMI-SDG6 (2023, 2026/27 and 2028/29) with aims to obtain data on the eleven global indicators from all countries of the world, with particular focus on areas with the greatest need of support. IMI-SDG6 will also serve as an engine for leveraging data use in policy, investment, and planning action at different levels, and will be providing intensive support to approximately 50 countries to facilitate better monitoring, reporting and data use.
The work of IMI-SDG6 is expected to provide value in the following ways:
* More holistic policies: Water and sanitation policy needs to take into account a number of interrelated issues including supply, consumption, resource management, and environment, and to involve a wide range of sectors and stakeholders. A comprehensive data set allows for better informed policy and investment decisions that account for synergies and trade-offs between them.
* Stronger accountability: A holistic and regular supply of data enables greater transparency and reduces the incidence of waste and corruption.  
* Leaving no one behind: Data disaggregation will help to identify the populations with unmet needs and higher levels of risk and to target policies and investments to reach those who most need it.
* Better learning across countries: A stronger global data set using common methodologies provides a common language for learning and sharing, and can serve as a platform for bringing together countries to discuss issues of water and sanitation implementation.
IMI-SDG6 aims to achieve universal coverage of all eleven SDG 6 global indicators in all countries, which will permit improved analysis of progress against both global and national water and sanitation targets and the identification of needs for acceleration. Already, analysis based on 2020 data has enabled UN-Water to conclude that in some cases we need to accelerate by a factor of four. This is a powerful message that has stimulated discussion and action.
IMI-SDG6 will also be able to use this data to identify past progress and to highlight achievements at the country level (Country Acceleration Snapshots) and to document and share lessons on the enabling conditions that led to that progress (Country Acceleration Case Studies). These will be powerful for inspiring action and enabling replication of good practices from one country to another.
SDG 6 on water and sanitation is one of the global goals with the highest potential for synergies with other SDGs. It has been shown that SDG 6 has interlinkages with a majority of the SDGs, with particularly strong links to agriculture [SDG 2], health [SDG 3], gender [SDG 5], energy [SDG 7], climate change and resilience [13], and the environment [SDG 14 and SDG 15].","IMI-SDG6 is an inter-agency partnership comprising the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat), the World Health Organization (WHO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), operating under the UN-Water umbrella.
Besides the UN agencies mentioned above, IMI-SDG6 is closely partnering with the Global Water Partnership (GWP), the African Ministers’ Council on Water (AMCOW) and other regional and global organisations.

Through preparedness and response for emergencies, sustainable provision of WASH and coordination, One WASH provides the framework for addressing a host of issues affecting the most vulnerable. One WASH is unique because it spans the emergency development divide and harnesses the collective capacity of our network of National Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies.  One WASH promotes a common yet adaptable approach for Red Cross and Red Crescent National Societies to establish large-scale, long-term and integrated public health and water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) projects. The IFRC and its membership have reached over 35 million people with sustainable access to WASH since 2005.  The integrated approach of One WASH aims, between now and 2030, to reach a minimum of 10 million vulnerable people in over 20 countries at high risk of epidemics and the effects of climate change.
One WASH will invest in sustainable long-term WASH programs, increasing access to levels that will reduce and prevent cholera and climate shocks. Year-round health and hygiene behavior change communication and social marketing programs will be implemented in communities, including advocacy and support to cholera vaccination campaigns. One WASH aims to improve access to safe water and adequate sanitation by constructing and rehabilitating facilities, as well as supporting the application of good hygiene practices and community water management. Hygiene behavior change interventions are delivered to ensure communities understand which hygiene practices may contribute to their increased risk of disease and which may play a preventative role.
The ONE WASH program concept seeks to reduce vulnerability and increase resilience by combining integrated public health and WASH projects that:
•	Improve community-based surveillance, preparedness and response capacity for cholera outbreaks and other potential epidemics and pandemics.
•	Increase investment in sustainable WASH infrastructure, adoption of climate ‘SMART’ WASH technology and innovative operation and management systems.
•	Scale up public health initiatives to improve nutrition, vaccination coverage, and health awareness.
•	Scale up investment in small scale food and livestock production linked to water supply, environmental protection, and water resource management.
•	Contribute to Government, other humanitarian and development actors and private sector efforts by supporting improved coordination, collective action, capacity building, inclusiveness and partnership development.","One WASH will provide direct, concrete and measurable action on SDG 6.  While increased collaboration and cooperation is a key aspect of the work, its main aim is to reduce the risk of epidemics and the effects of climate change by increasing the number of people in vulnerable communities who have access to sustainable water, sanitation and hygiene.
We urgently need to accelerate and scale up water action to mitigate the impacts of water related risks and increase the climate resilience of the most vulnerable communities. Without urgent, coordinated and large-scale action to tackle water-related risks, we will fail to deliver the commitments taken under the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular SDG 6, the Paris Agreement and the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015–2030.
The world needs more than words on this.  We need to think about it in terms of investment.  The return on investment in WASH, in terms of increased economic productivity and reduced expenditure in disaster response, is one of the highest in the humanitarian and development sector.  Every death from cholera is preventable, we can build WASH infrastructure that resists climate shocks.  If the world made the necessary investment in providing universal access to WASH, and we believe this is achievable, we would have fewer problems associated with climate change and a whole host of other benefits.
If we can combine more local, efficient response with reduced risk, we can face the challenge of climate change and leave no one behind.","Red Cross Red Crescent Societies, Donors, Governments",Goal 6,"6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.5, 6.a, 6.b","Tue, 03/22/2022 - 12:00","Tue, 01/01/2030 - 12:00",,0.75,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

The CFRP will have a Centre of Excellence (CoE) on Coastal Protection and Flood Management as the main vehicle to carry out in-house research and to drive and integrate coastal-related research agenda. The CoE aims to attract and anchor international experts and researchers to Singapore for research collaborations. Through knowledge transfer and research collaborations, this will over time help to build up the local capacity and expertise in coastal protection solutioning.

The implementation and operation of coastal protection measures over the next 100 years is estimated to cost around S$100 billion.

The CFRP aims to builds a sustainable and vibrant research and development (R&D) ecosystem through collaborative research. This is pivotal to support the development of new coastal protection and flood management solutions to protect Singapore’s coastlines against sea level rise from climate change. These solutions will be designed to be effective, multi-functional, adaptive, sustainable, and tailored to address Singapore’s constraints and challenges in coastal protection and flood resilience.

Finland is located by the Baltic Sea, a semi-enclosed shallow sea with a large catchment area. The main environmental problem in the Baltic Sea is eutrophication, with the nutrient run-off from diffuse sources on land being the most important cause. Therefore, recognizing the importance of the catchment area in managing the environmental problems at sea is essential and close cooperation and integration of water and marine protection policies is needed for measures to be effective. Finland has merged water and marine policies in practice by combining the governance structures for water and marine protection. We have common national steering and coordination groups for water resources and marine environment management. In addition, regional authorities responsible for implementation of the water and marine legislation and stakeholder cooperation are the same. 
The aim of integrated governance is a concerted preparation of River Basin Management Plans and the Marine Strategy for Finland, which include measures to achieve a good status of waters. The programmes of measures are renewed every six years. Joint preparation enables cost-efficient and well targeted measures for achieving the environmental objectives of good status in surface and ground waters as well as coastal and marine waters. 
The framework includes work at national level but also collaborative governance together with regional and local authorities as well as with the stakeholders. Effective integration of water and marine protection to sectoral policies (e.g. agriculture, industries, energy etc.) is essential for source to sea management of waters.","Integrated governance contributes towards achieving both the SDG 6 and SDG 14 targets in Finnish inland waters and in the Baltic Sea. 
The integrated governance will result in better aligned River Basin Management Plans and Marine Strategy, including identification of most cost-efficient and targeted measures to reduce the pressures for both freshwater and marine ecosystems. The integrated governance can also save resources in the planning process and helps in targeted implementation of the measures.

The partnership will develop comprehensive sustainable water management indicators that will be applied to multiple Asian cities to evaluate and measure the progress of water quality improvement towards sustainable practices and identify potential pathways to improve it in the course of their socio-economic growth. This partnership will connect academic institutions and governments in several Asian countries, e.g., Thailand, Vietnam, Japan, and China, highlighting opportunities for repositioning the present actions to strengthen the capacities of national and local institutions and stakeholders for cross-sectoral cooperation and closer partnership. The two-year partnership will mobilize in-kind contributions in the form of three experts and financial resources, deliver reports, and participate in international conferences. This action will address the International Decade for Action ""Water for Sustainable Development,"" aiming to further improve cooperation, partnership, capacity development, and catalyze action.
The partnership will develop at least one policy brief, which will include policy recommendations related to sustainable water management in Asian cities. It will also develop an index toolkit that will include comprehensive sustainable water management indicators to evaluate and measure progress towards sustainable practices in Asian cities. The results for Asian cities will be published in a report. The report will include findings from research conducted in multiple Asian cities regarding water quality and sustainable practices.
In this partnership, three experts will be dispatched to conduct research and facilitate the partnership between academic institutions and governments in Asian countries. The partnership will allocate approximately 20,000 USD in funding to support the development of the policy brief, report, and index toolkit. Other in-kind activities will be organizing stakeholder workshops in Asian states to promote cross-sectoral cooperation and partnership, as well as participation in conferences to share knowledge and disseminate findings.

Traditional rainwater management has been to drain it as soon as possible and protect at the downstream side using a small number of large structures with the top-down approach guided by the government. The objective of this movement is to promote a new solution for the climate crisis following a new water paradigm, which is to harvest rainwater at the source using many small structures with public-private partnerships as local action.
Especially, in Korea where 65% is mountainous, it is very much necessary to make multi-purpose rainwater retention facilities in the middle of mountains to prevent mountain fires and avoid flooding and soil erosion. Each facility can contain 10-20 m3 of water during the flooding time and can store 1-2 m3 of water for firefighting and protecting the ecosystem. It can be constructed easily by using locally available natural wood and stones and local labor. The system will be designed so that one facility can cover 1000~2000m2 of the catchment area.
It can be mobilized by the members of the Korean Red Cross, which has national local organizations at the village level and RCYs at the school level. The basic idea is to make local action to protect the local by the local people. Private companies can also join the movement to select one valley and make it under their leadership and sense of ownership.
Rain For All will make a master plan to do the movement, train the trainers, educate the citizen and promote and evaluate the performance of the system. Korean red Cross will mobilize the members at each village and school. Companies will donate the money and personnel to make such movements locally as their CSR and ESG activities.
Korean Red Cross will propose such actions through the International Federation of Red Cross.","By simply making a large number of small rainwater retaining structures in the mountains, integrated water resource management (IWRM) can be easily achieved (SDG6.5). Resulting many water-related problems will be mitigated: the flooding risk will be reduced. By groundwater infiltration water scarcity can be (SDG6.4) will be replenished. There are side effects to mitigate mountain fire and heat wave effects by rehydrating the surface of the earth. By retaining water, the ecosystem will be revitalized and the carbon can be captured by the plant. This movement can be a local action for the UN Decade of Eco-Restoration.
The most important thing is to enable local action for the IWRM and pride in it (SDG6.a) following the success story of the Korean Saemaul Movement which became a model in developing countries. Through the network and training program of the Korean Red Cross, we can train the teachers how to cope with climate change through local actions (SDG4.c).

The Initiative enables the United Nations system and its multi-stakeholder partners to 'deliver as one' in supporting countries to develop capacities to accelerate progress towards SDG 6. The Initiative responds to countries’ specific capacity development needs by facilitating support from the United Nations system and other development partners at various levels of operation. The SDG 6 Capacity Development Initiative has four main objectives: 1. Provide a coordinated entry point for countries requesting UN-Water’s support to identify capacity gaps hindering the implementation of SDG 6. 2. Support countries in undertaking a capacity gap assessment through inter-sectoral, inter-ministerial and multi-stakeholder approaches. 3. Facilitate access to capacity development support from UN-Water Members and Partners, tailoring them as needed, and ensuring follow-up of capacity development activities. 4. Raise awareness of the indispensable role that water and sanitation play within the sustainable development scope, in particular for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda and for the realization of all human rights, and of the importance of involving other key stakeholders in capacity development efforts, such as civil society, academia, the private sector, local governments, technicians and operators, including those in the informal sector. The implementation process of the SDG 6 Capacity Development Initiative begins with a formal request by a Member State to UNESCO and UN DESA, to request the Initiative to support strengthening the national capacities either in general or in a certain area, for instance, groundwater. With the support of the UN system, the Member State identifies relevant stakeholders and priorities. Ownership and buy-in are sought from the highest national levels, to build political will to be accompanied by an integrated workshop for that level, then followed by a country gaps assessment exercise, which will lead to the preparation of a national capacity development plan related to the water sector and the implementation of capacity development amongst national government ministries and other key national stakeholders. The entire process highlights the prominence and ownership of Member States for the respective national processes, which would be tailor-made for the national needs. The engagement of the Initiative is followed up through high-level meetings at the national level to evaluate the success of its progress and where further efforts need to be made. The UN-Water Global Analysis and Assessment of Sanitation and Drinking-Water (GLAAS) and other monitoring activities of the SDG 6 Integrated Monitoring Initiative are leveraged to monitor the progress of the Initiative and its contributions to the accelerated realization of the SDG 6 targets.","The SDG 6 Capacity Development Initiative supports coordination on SDG 6-related capacity development work, facilitates uptake and deployment of capacity development activities, and accelerates implementation of SDG 6 and other water-related targets as part of the UN Decade of Action and the SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework. In collaboration with the UN Country Teams, the Initiative provides the opportunity for countries to develop or augment a national capacity development plan related to the water sector, based on a gaps assessment and country priorities. The UN Country Teams can utilize these tools to tailor responses to Member States’ specific needs and realities, ensuring that all entities can effectively support national implementation of the water-related goals and targets of the 2030 Agenda. The Initiative can support countries to move towards systemic strengthening and national capacity development ownership to ensure sustainability and longer-term results. The Initiative not only focuses SDG 6 but also fosters cross-sectoral collaboration, interlinking key issues such as human rights, climate change, energy, finance, food, gender equality, social inclusion, nature-based solutions and source-to-sea approaches. Training packages from UN-Water Members and Partners are included in the list of so-called “modules” to ensure that the sector efforts are captured and to inform relevant potential beneficiaries of the current “off the shelf” offerings. The modules will be made available to countries as a potential resource to help better access and tailor activities from across the UN-Water family. Furthermore, the Initiative helps countries ensure that their capacity development plans consider the principles defined in the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework guidance document as well as the guiding principles of the SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework: having a human rights-based approach; leaving no one behind and prioritizing the vulnerable; putting gender equality at the heart of programming and unleashing female and youth potential; inclusivity; conflict sensitivity; planning for resilience/sustainability; and making scientific evidence a prerequisite.","Centre for Affordable Water and Sanitation Technology (CAWST), CDP Worldwide (CPD), Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Human Right 2 Water (HR2W), International Association of Hydrogeologists (IAH), International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research (IAHR), International Association of Hydrological Sciences (IAHS), International Groundwater Resources Assessment Centre (IGRAC), IHE Delft Institute for Water Education (IHE Delft), International Labour Organization (ILO), International Organization for Migration (IOM), International Water and Sanitation Centre (IRC), International Water Association (IWA), International Water Management Institute (IWMI), International Water Resources Association (IWRA), Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), Ramsar Convention on Wetlands, Rural Water Supply Network (RWSN), Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI), Sanitation and Water for All (SWA), United Nations Development Program (UNDP) including Cap-Net, United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR), United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), UNEP Global Environment Monitoring Systems (GEMS)/Water, UNEP DHI – Centre on Water and Environment, UNEP World Water Quality Alliance (WWQA), United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-HABITAT), United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), United Nations University (UNU), WaterAid, Women for Water Partnership (WfWP), World Health Organization (WHO), World Bank Group","Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 4, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 8, Goal 9, Goal 10, Goal 11, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 14, Goal 15, Goal 16, Goal 17",,"Mon, 03/22/2021 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2030 - 12:00",,0.0,0.5555555555555556,0.0,0.25,0.0,0.05494505494505515

In 2018 the current government received the water supply and distribution system in very unfavorable conditions. Lacking maintenance and major restorations for a couple of decades, it was filled with inneficiencies and did not operate with energy efficiency, which limited the water supply for the population.
To guarantee water availability for the population and strengthen MAG water resilience, this administration implemented a strategy to renew the existing water supply and distribution infrastructure, and to develop a new supply source, in collaboration with state water agencies, potable water supply organizations and local governments. The main objective of this strategy was to increase water availability for the MAG in cubic meters per second.
The strategy consisted of the following actions classified in two units:
  A. Renovation of current supply system and construction of new pumping and potabilization plants, distribution lines, and supply sources
      -Conclusion of metropolitan distribution ring line (to interchange water amongst potabilization plants)
      -Renewal of existing pumping stations and reservoir tanks
      -New pumping station in Ocotlan municipality
      -New supply wells and distribution lines in El Salto and Juanacatlán municipalities
      -Cleaning and restoration of existing conveying channels
      -Construction of 1 new potabilization plants and renovation of 3 existing ones
      -Developing of new supply wells

By promoting the action of monitoring micropollutants and water quality of the Hydrographic Basin that drains its waters to the Itaipu Reservoir with the issuance of reports, bulletins and diagnostic reports, Itaipu and its partners benefit all users of water resources. The materials are important because there is no way to promote the efficient management of water resources without accurate and effective monitoring and evaluation of current conditions and forecasts","Brazil, Paraguay",Latin America and the Caribbean,"Water management supported by data resulting from monitoring programs and scientific research projects is an initiative that had its beginnings in the 70s  with the formation of a binational joint commission that later evolved into partnerships with universities, institutes and laboratories of Itaipu. The parameters studied, the technology employed and the methodologies have accompanied the analytical challenges. In general, various parameters are analyzed in water body quality studies. These parameters enable the establishment of its quality from geo-chemical, ecological and sanitary perspectives, as well as to support management decisions that are likely to impact on the various uses of water, such as hydraulic, technological, landscape and recreational. The Itaipu initiative seeks to provide data-driven responses to the requirements of the multiple uses and for the production of energy with an environmental approach.  
Several technological innovations, as well as advanced equipment for the detection of micropollutants have been acquired, following the scientific development on the subject.  These innovations are being implemented to achieve Itaipu's new objectives: to produce energy with sustainability and water safety. 
Currently, the Brazilian monitoring network consists of 24 stations within the  Itaipu reservoir, 16 in the Paraná 3 Hydrographic Basin, sampled quarterly, and 8 on the artificial beaches, which are monitored weekly in the summer.  
On the Paraguayan margin of the reservoir, 60 points are monitored, including streams, rivers, wetlands, springs, and beaches.","Data from this network is used as an environmental indicator and driver of conservation actions on land use, aquaculture production and basic sanitation, as proposed by the Environmental Management Programs. 
In addition to the benefits for power generation, monitoring water contributes to the public and environmental health of the region, as well as advising the Basin Committees and other legally established agencies. The data and information support the preparation of Basin and Sanitation Plans, which support decision-making regarding water quality standards compatible with multiple water uses (supply, aquaculture, irrigation, leisure etc.).","For the development of this action, ITAIPU Binacional counts on the collaboration of Academic Institutions such as the University of Latin American Integration (UNILA), The National University of Assuncióon (UNA) and government institutions responsible for the Management of Water Resources in Brazil and Paraguay.","Goal 6, Goal 17","6.3, 6.5, 6.b , 17.6, 17.17","Sun, 01/01/2023 - 12:00","Sun, 12/31/2023 - 12:00","https://www.itaipu.gov.br/meioambiente/monitoramento-e-avaliacao-ambien…

The Communities of Practice (CoPs) will build a space for continuous exchange among all relevant stakeholders paying special attention to the social context and facilitating gender-specific dialogues and ensuring the continuity of those exchanges, the knowledge gathered, and the best practices shared. The CoPs operated by a local CoP manager will be built on and embedded within ongoing initiatives and projects like River Basin Management Plans  and CoP on Vjosa River Basin in Albania, Volta Flood and Drought Management projects and the ongoing GWP work in Bhutan, therefore maximising the potential of each location. 
Following the CoPs’ life cycle methodology (definition and design, launching, growing, long-term sustaining), strong attention will be paid to key success facets of CoPs: vision and objectives; identification of stakeholders and governance; leadership; convening avenues; how to sustain collaboration and cooperation; community management and related roles; user-centric approach responding to members’ needs; and measurement of the community vitality. This will ensure that pilot CoPs will operate as structured and inclusive platforms, providing a neutral space for enhanced interactions among sectors and stakeholders. 
Through a participatory approach, the core CoP team will define stakeholders’ expectations, and co-design services that the platform will provide. This process will lead to a Community Charter, which will articulate the CoP’s purpose and focus, membership, value proposition, modus operandi, activity plan, roles, resources needed, and measures of success. 
In addition to the networking and advocacy approach embedded in the CoP, the knowledge transfer approach will unfold through creating an online repository of materials relevant to the stakeholders, capacity building and learning activities, including peer-to-peer training.","The desired impact is to achieve enhanced knowledge and capacity among actors to take more sustainable and gender transformative water management and investment decisions. The impact will be primarily realised through the application of IWRM principles into water governance processes led by the targeted institutions in the pilot locations, resulting in all-inclusive decision-making processes and more sustainable investments in water resources management.  
The targeted impact will be directly related to existing development objectives and priorities in the pilot locations as per the overall project approach of building on and enhancing ongoing processes and initiatives. A detailed landscape mapping will be carried out in each of the pilot locations to determine the best activities that will contribute to long-term location-specific objectives. An understanding of gender-specific barriers will result from this mapping, and recommendations to address these will be outlined, and addressed to the extent possible, through the CoPs and relevant capacity development initiatives.

These breaches can be traced back to collective mismanagement, driven by economic institutions that take water for granted. The Commission argues that we will fail on climate change and on virtually all Sustainable Development Goals if we fail on water, and that therefore we need to re-think and re-imagine our economic institutions. 
The global water cycle connects nations in more profound ways than previously understood. We are connected through transboundary water flows in rivers, lakes and groundwater, but also through atmospheric water flows. This means that we can no longer address water as a local challenge. No country relies on its own territory as a source for more than half of the rainfall it receives. All nations depend on stable oceans, intact forests, and healthy ecosystems in neighbouring countries to secure the rainfall in their own. Yet capacities of land and oceans to generate water are being destabilized. 
Redressing this requires the integration of water into national economic policies and an integrated approach to resource management, where decisions on land (including urbanization), water, and energy resources are made in tandem and cognizant of the likely impacts on biodiversity loss and climate change, and vice versa. 
About 90 per cent of countries already prioritize action on water for adaptation in their NDCs, but implementation of climate commitments and the financing needed to do so are where the real challenges lie. Coordination across environment, finance, planning and sectoral ministries and across different levels of government is required to develop and implement investment plans and attract the financing needed. 
The NDC Partnership (NDCP), with over 200 members, including countries and international institutions, is ideally positioned to mobilize technical and other forms of support to help countries leverage opportunities across the “Water Nexus”.
With the initial financial support of the Netherlands, the NDC Partnership will provide technical assistance to put water at the heart of economic decisions-making plans and the implementation thereof, by enhancing the integration of water in formulating, updating, financing and implementing of countries’ NDCs.","NDC Partnership actions will put water at the heard of economic decision-making plans and the implementation thereof.

            Low impact sludge treatment - After methanization, sludge recycled in local fertilization",civil society,France,Europe,"The Syndicat des Eaux et de l’Assainissement Alsace Moselle (SDEA), a widely acknowledegd utility, intervene in all areas of the water cycle (water, wastewater and river basin management). As such, SDEA has a long commitment to sustainable development, recognised as exemplary at international level: SDEA was winner of the EFQM Circular Economy Challenge in 2022.
By analysing the global and local context and establishing dialogues with stakeholders, SDEA identified the main water circle issues and mapped them against the UNSDGs, so that clear actions were identified. These were the inputs of SDEA’s Water Circular Economy Policy which consists of seven commitments: 
-	Preventing mud flooding impacts, to protect citizens and keep soils in a good state, consistent with agricultural practices and crops at efficient levels ;
-	Preserving water resources, common good of the citizens, farmers, and aquatic life, by the promotion of sustainable farming practices ;
-	Developping smart patterns of water consumption, promoting good practices by the citizens (lessening of the use of harmful or hazardous products, promotion of tap water use, ….) thus limiting water treatments and tariffs, by keeping aquifers safe ;
-	Designing durable networks and infrastructure, anticipating environmental impacts (climate change, energy and water scarcity…) through specifics asset management policies ;
-	Preserving effluent quality, through local partnerships with farmers, industrial unions, to prevent at source the pollution by non-biodegradable pollutants, chemicals or pesticides and help them towards more responsible and efficient practices, taking into account the polluter-pays principle ;
-	Promoting use of nature-based solutions for water treatment and rainwater management, by inciting towns, land owners and building firms toward rustic rainwater management solutions, controlling raintime discharges and building wasterwater treatment plants with natural ponds as means of additional water purification ;
-	Using wastewater sludge and other valuable constituent from water processing as local resources, by producing energy, sludge recycling as free fertilizer as much as possible, and promoting local integrated solutions as means of a local circular water economy.
SDEA has initiated a local pioneer approach in the Herbsheim area, to manage the water cycle in circular and sustainable ways, with multifactorial practices. This approach has been designed, deployed and endorsed with all local stakeholders (French Republic, elected representatives, farmers, …) :
-	The new local wastewater treatment plant, replacing an outperformed one, is designed to let go better-treated water and consume low levels of power. It produces energy (biogas) using its own waste (wastewater sludge) and silphium crops,
-	In the water catchment areas, an agreement to produce untreated crops has been found, with the production of silphium perforliatum crops ; those crops useful for the preservation of the aquifer, have also positive biodiversity by-effects (bee and small fauna shelter, honey production) and are used with waste to produce energy. Being untreated, the water resources for farmers and citizens is kept safe, and local farmers benefit from a guaranteed revenue with a low-cost crop ;
-	The waste residue is locally recycled","SDEA’s sustainable development policy is built in cooperation with its stakeholders, its agents and its administrators (elected officials, mayors, local representatives…), and  formalized around commun objectives, taking UNO’s Sustainable Development Goals as inputs.
Being a communal public syndicate, SDEA is a non-profit organization whose goals are naturally aligned with objectives relatives to good health, drinkable water, affordability of the public services, and biodiversity (in and out water).
The seven main commitments  have all been evaluated for their pertinence with the sustainable development goals (quoted below by their number, between brackets) :
-	The prevention of mud flooding impacts betters the quality of water and lessens rainfall impact in the wastewater grid [6]. It targets better cultural practices  and preserves a good soil quality collaboratively with the farmers, thus preserving their source of income  [8, 17], protecting the towns below from flooding [11] and taking into account the progressive aggravation of storm events and the rarefaction of usable rain for the farmers [13] by promoting wet conservation coverages.
-	Preserving the water resource, apart from its obvious benefits to water [6, 14] is done collaboratively with the farmers and their unions [17], to ensure that crops may continue to be produced sustainably, including adaptation to climate change and educational programs to grow better-adapted crops and limit the use of unsustainable fertilizers or phytopharmaceuticals [2, 4, 8, 12, 13] ;
-	The smart water patterns of consumption target a sustainable disposability of drinkable water, with the lowest treatment rate possible, insuring durability of the availability and urbanization linked to the grid [6, 11, 12] ;
-	Designing efficient networks and structures has obvious benefits for the durability of water and wastewater grids, and of service furniture [6, 9, 11, 12]. It also is positive for biodiversity, ensuring a lessened consumption of resources, particularly water from aquifers, which stays available for the ecosystems and is less treated (or with less reagents) [14, 15] ;
-	 The preservation of effluent quality is a stepstone of a good wastewater treatment, and ensures a good recycling of water, particularly important if the effluent is less diluted due to more frequent droughts [6, 12, 13, 14]. It requires, though, good practices from the economical actors (craftmen, industries…) which shall be implemented through a partnership with their unions or representatives, with the support of industry police services from the State [9, 17] :
-	Using nature-based solutions to treat water lead to better results, with a diminished consumption of harmful or polluting devices and reagents [6, 11, 12, 14] ;
-	Projects of reuse of the valuable constituents of water treatment (particularly to produce energy or avoid GHG emissions) is totally integrative of circular economy principles [7, 11, 12, 13]. The reflexes promoted by this initiative require a promotion of good practices for all actors (particularly general public and farmers), benefiting the water ressources as a whole [4, 6].","Elected officials, mayors, local representatives…

As part of the partnership, a best practice for digital water governance has been enacted. 
With this initiative, the partners commit to sharing blueprints for this best practice digital water governance with environmental and water regulators. Their aim is to enhance and accelerate their ability to close the time gap between a political decision and its execution. 
DEPA has in total approximately 250 processes. Amongst these are 45 processes related to grants and 90 processes related to inspections and environmental policing. The remaining relate to license and permitting. The water governance elements include blueprints for digital environmental permitting (Environmental Impact Assessments), dissemination of funds for protection of water resources, and inspections of wastewater.
For several years, the partners have been working to develop models and software based on best practices to accelerate processing the agency’s work while reducing the costs of administration and enabling transparency. This has included supporting work processes end-to-end, from self-services for citizens and companies, to case processing and filing. Subsequently reducing workload, ensuring compliance, and eliminating fraud. This has led to measurable results in reduced administration costs, improved citizen services, fraud prevention and increased transparency.
As a first step, the partners have used formalized methods to analyze government best practices and develop generic process models and standards, describing different types (“classes”) of government climate and environmental processes. By taking these processes as the starting point for the work, the aim has been to understand and describe government best practices within digitized working environments, while avoiding the limitations of specific technologies. 
Standards and best practices can accelerate the deployment of governmental climate and environment programs. 
As part of our commitment to SDGs 6 and 13, we will subsequently donate and publicly share the technologically neutral standards and best practices for environmental permitting, protection of water resources, and wastewater inspections for the benefit of governmental organizations around the world.
Furthermore, cBrain A/S commits to deploy the necessary technical expertise to water regulators on national, state, or local level, who wish to adapt the best practice water governance developed in Denmark to their own regulatory environment aiming to provide accelerated access to digitization of their administration.
Finally, the end-goal of the initiative is to establish a network of environmental and water regulators who wish to collaborate closely on their digital transformation. Members of the network will be granted extended access to the process library availing them of the actual xml-templates for reuse of the processes.","The partners believe that sharing and adapting standards and best practices for digital water governance with governments around the world will have a significant impact on increasing access to drinking water and sanitation, as well as combatting pollution, climate change, and destruction of nature.",Danish Environmental Protection Agency,"Goal 6, Goal 13, Goal 16, Goal 17","6.3, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 13.2, 13.b, 16.5, 16.6, 16.a, 17.7, 17.17","Thu, 03/23/2023 - 12:00","Sun, 10/01/2028 - 12:00",htttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/cbrain-sustainability/,0.5,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

Together with FAO we work on the open-access WaPOR platform that support farmers to improve water productivity and soon will have global coverage. 
Satellite earth observation is changing the way we can understand, value and manage water and, consequently, take more effective action to achieve water-related goals and targets. Satellite information can describe almost every facet of the water cycle in near real time and how it interacts with different uses and sectors. Satellite based datasets provide the technical support to build effective water commitments by: (1) quantify the current state of water resources, (2) consider trends and anomalies, and (3) estimate impact of climate change, population growth and other factors on water.
One particular important component is actual evapotranspiration: the water consumption by crops, other vegetation and the soil surface. Contrary to precipitation,  evapotranspiration can be managed. Water managers – whether at field level or large scale – need to have a good understanding of evapotranspiration and its spatial and temporal variations across changing landscapes  to inform key decision-making, whether on the short-run or long-run. 
eLEAF has a data factory that produces satellite-based data on water consumption (actual evapotranspiration), water stress (transpiration deficit and soil moisture) and water productivity (biomass production per unit water consumption) at scale, both spatially (from field to global scale) as temporally (from daily to yearly, historically and near real-time). Our data is scalable, up-to-date and consistent, and can be converted into action-ready indicators on water availability and scarcity, and customized into services for specific users.","High-quality satellite based data and information will help any decision maker to make informed decisions and increase accountability but also to scale up innovative practices and technologies to improved water resources management and water productivity. Our satellite earth observation data on water helps the public and private sector as well as farmers to understand water usage and water risks and make informed decisions for more sustainable water management.
With support of the Netherlands, FAO has developed an open-access database using satellite data that allows monitoring of water productivity  in Africa and the Near East. This database is the heart of FAO’s portal to monitor Water Productivity through Open access of Remotely sensed information (WaPOR). eLEAF developed the methodology and produces the WaPOR data on actual evapotranspiration, biomass production and agricultural water productivity.

The mountain cryosphere provides crucial water resources for drinking, agriculture, industry, and hydropower, while also supporting essential ecosystems in mountain and downstream areas. Furthermore, the melting of mountain glaciers, in combination with polar ice sheets, contributes to sea-level rise; in addition to directly threatening low-lying communities and infrastructure, this also results in increasing saltwater incursion impacting freshwater availability for coastal communities. 
Yet despite recent advances in knowledge about climate-induced changes in the global cryosphere, especially around projected future impacts of cryosphere melt at different levels of global warming with direct relevance to the Water Action Agenda, these changes are minimally understood and under-appreciated by voters and decision-makers. Therefore, despite the significance of the cryosphere to societies around the world – including those that are far from ice and snow – the cryosphere has too often been marginal to global policymaking around both climate ambition and water action.
The International Cryosphere Climate Initiative (ICCI) therefore works to support urgent and ambitious climate action in order to preserve as much of the global cryosphere as possible – and thus to safeguard the lives and livelihoods of billions of people worldwide, particularly in mountain, downstream, and low-lying areas. This includes work in mountain regions to address heating and combined heating-cooking stoves, as well as agricultural burning; these projects protect watersheds by decreasing black carbon that impacts ice and snow as well as health, preserving forest biomass and preserving water through fire-free conservation agriculture methods that also decrease fertilizer pollution and eutrophication in nearby waterways.
ICCI also serves as the Secretariat to the “Ambition on Melting Ice” (AMI) on Sea-level Rise and Mountain Water Resources high-level group. The AMI Declaration at COP27 brought together 20 countries from mountain and polar regions, as well as those dependent on mountain water resources and healthy coastal aquifers (see “Countries”). AMI will work to ensure that policy-relevant knowledge about climate-induced changes in the global cryosphere is understood by publics and policymakers worldwide; to support policymaking at all levels that is informed by the latest evidence from cryosphere science and advances urgent and ambitious climate action; and to assist countries with adaptation and disaster risk reduction related to the growing, serious impacts of cryosphere change, including as linked to the Water Action Agenda.","ICCI has a strong and extensive network of Governments, IGOs, NGOs, and scientific institutions. ICCI brings these stakeholders together to advance urgent, ambitious climate action to preserve as much of the global cryosphere as possible, thereby making important contributions to the Water Action Agenda. In line with ICCI’s mission – as well as the Water Action Agenda, the recent UNGA resolution A/RES/77/172, and other recent initiatives such as the International Year of Sustainable Mountain Development 2022 and the upcoming UN International Year of Glaciers 2025 – ICCI’s commitment is intended to accelerate the implementation of SDG 6 and 13, which are inextricably interlinked through the cryosphere. Under Goal 6, ICCI’s activities through this commitment will help to ensure the availability and management of freshwater by supporting global governments to preserve water resources that are stored in the mountain cryosphere through mitigation action; while also supporting Governments, IGOs, and civil society to adapt to inevitable changes in mountain water resources that result from committed glacier loss. Under Goal 13, ICCI will continue to support Governments to take urgent action to mitigate climate change at a global scale, with the goals of minimizing cryosphere loss and therefore the loss of freshwater resources, as well as minimizing saltwater incursion into freshwater resources.","Cryosphere scientists, academic institutions, IGOs and NGOs globally, as well as members of the ""Ambition on Melting Ice"" (AMI) on Sea-Level Rise and Mountain Water Resources high-level group.","Goal 6, Goal 13",,"Thu, 03/23/2023 - 12:00","Sat, 03/23/2024 - 12:00","-AMI Declaration: https://iccinet.org/ambition-on-melting-ice/

They believe that where the problem lies, the solution can be found. This is their starting point: local communities should be engaged in decision-making processes, so that together policies and intervention can be co-created that will do what these were envisioned to do.
Right2Grow engaged communities and conducted consultations (Uganda (51 people), Mali (8 people) and South Sudan (21)). What was re-discovered: interlinked problems ask for interlinked solutions. Communities face a myriad of issues which are complex and connected, but what stands out: water is seen as the starting point of lifting people out of poverty by kickstarting an upward spiral effect of positive benefits.
To do so, essentially WASH infrastructure implementation needs to be accelerated. Together with communities Right2Grow and Davis & Shirtliff will explore the benefits of solar powered water management – as a green source of energy – could have for them.
Right2Grow will ensure that the way infrastructure and corresponding interventions are realised is well-tailored towards the needs and priorities of people. As a locally rooted civil society network is well positioned to play that role. Specific focus will be on pricing, frequency of payments,  operation and maintenance ,sustainable use, equitable access  to cater for ability and willingness to pay aspects .

            Data generated to be integrated in the wider environmental quality assessment/index.",Local communities,Indonesia,Asia and Pacific,"Water is essential for every living being. It is crucial and underpins almost everything we do toward sustainable development. The right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation is a human right, as derived from the right to an adequate standard of living. As a result of growing population, expanding industrialization and economic growth, as well as increasing agricultural activities, water demand is therefore rising exponentially. The decline in environmental quality also remains a serious threat to ecosystem services, particularly in the provision of water, which is critical for ensuring food security as one of the key to the survival of the people. It is therefore achieving sustainable development goals, will be in line with improving environmental quality. Environment quality improvement has been carried out through various measures to control pollution and environmental degradation, both by the central government and local governments. The Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MoEF) as the central government has a specific mandate to—among others—carry out the management and improvement of environmental quality, through the implementation of comprehensive pollution and degradation control measures, including to increase water quality. In order to formulate effective policy and management interventions, water quality monitoring and assessment are indispensable in identifying water quality status, trends and its most critical impacts. Monitoring provides the objective evidence necessary to make sound decisions on managing water quality for today and for the future.  Indonesia therefore is committed to scale-up the implementation of ONLIMO monitoring program. ONLIMO is an online and real-time water quality monitoring system using sensors integrated with data logger units, data transmission units and a software systems that is compatible for water quality monitoring in rivers, lakes, reservoirs, beaches and sea waters or even wastewater in industries. Measurements were made on the following parameters: Salinity, NO3, ORP, pH, NH4, Conductivity, COD, TDS, BOD, SWSG, DO, Turbidity, and Regularity. The technical consideration used to determine monitoring points for ONLIMO, including:
-	Representing sources of pollution (point and non-point source);
-	Located in the main outlets of watersheds;
-	Located in the intake point of drinking water processing facilities;
-	Located in the upstream with less to no influence of human intervention;
-	Number of sampling units must represent a balance of upstream, mid, and downstream.","Indonesia declared 15 priority watersheds to be rehabilitated in its 2015-2019 Mid-term Development Plan. Until 2022, at least 73 units of ONLIMO have been installed and fully operated in 13 priority watersheds using the central government’s budget. Whereas, additional 127 units have been installed from 2017-2022 using Special Allocation Fund for the local governments. The entire units are also fully integrated with the MoEF system and is expected to be integrated in the National Environmental Quality Assessment starting from 2023. The online and real time water quality data generated from the ONLIMO system is expected to make up the wider Water Quality Index composition, in order to:
-	Rapidly demonstrate the trend of water quality changes/fluctuations;
-	Provide early warning system in case of pollution events (emergency);
-	Reduce the cost and time of sampling and lab analysis;
-	Raise awareness of the general public to honor the right of information; and
-	Reduce the risk of danger, accident and human error in sampling and lab analysis.
The monitoring will be the basis for intervention in order to improve the health and productivity of the community, supporting food and energy security, as well as ultimately supporting the achievement of SDG 6 of clean water and sanitation by improving access to safely managed drinking water and safely managed sanitation services.","Line ministries, Private sectors, General Public","Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 6, Goal 11, Goal 13, Goal 15",,"Thu, 01/01/2015 - 12:00","Tue, 01/01/2030 - 12:00",,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05494505494505515

            -	Integrating Peatland Ecosystems’ Quality Index into the National Environmental Quality Index","Local communities, ITPC members, ASEAN Member States",Indonesia,Asia and Pacific,"Indonesia is the custodian of the biggest tropical peatland in the world which houses vital biodiversity, while also helping mitigate climate change as highly effective carbon sinks. Peatland ecosystem regulates the stability of water systems as it stores water during rainy season and flows it during the dry season. In many parts of Indonesia, Peatlands supply food and other ecosystem services that sustain economies. However, peatlands are vulnerable ecosystems in a wider landscape. Drainage can have a significant impact and lead to irreversible degradation of the peatland site, including reducing the quality of drinking water, according to IUCN. Canal construction can also have an impact on lowering the groundwater level, increasing the risk of peatland fires during the dry season. It sometimes correlated with changes in land cover on peatland and exacerbate existing problems of water.
The Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MoEF), Indonesia, has the mandate to—among others—carry out the management and improvement of environmental quality, through the implementation of comprehensive pollution and degradation control measures, including to increase water quality, as well as to sustainably manage and restore peatland ecosystems. Restoring peatland ecosystems has the objective of improving the quality of peatland management in degraded peatland area with a target of new 25.000 ha in 2023 and additional 30.000 ha in 2024. Additionally, Indonesia has established Peatland and Mangrove Restoration Agency (BRGM) to strengthen coordination and facilitate the acceleration of peatland restoration and improve peatland-adjacent communities' livelihoods in seven priority provinces in Indonesia. BRGM has implemented efforts to restore peatlands with a total restoration area in 2021 of 300,346 ha. According to its establishment mandate, the total restoration target from its establishment till 2024 is at 1,2 million ha.
In a strong, coordinated and collaborative manner, there have been considerable management measures carried out by both MoEF and BRGM, including data and information collection through inventory and mapping peatland functions, increasing effectiveness of protection and management plans, and increasing effectiveness of the restoration of peatland hydrological units. The measure follow the three main pillars of restoration approach of Rewetting (R1), Re-vegetation (R2), and Revitalization (R3) or best known as 3R:
-	Rewetting aims to maintain the soil moisture and reduce and/or minimize the drainage rate through the construction of rewetting infrastructures such as canal blocking, deep well, and canal backfilling.
-	Re-vegetation is an action to restore land cover in peatland ecosystems through replanting activities on peatlands. Replanting is carried out for several purposes, including replanting endemic plants and adaptive plants on open peatlands, enrichment planting in degraded peat forest areas, and enhancing and applying seed dispersal techniques to stimulate regeneration of peatland vegetation.
-	Whereas the R3 stands for revitalization of economic activities for peatland-adjacent communities to improve livelihoods.  This pillar is implemented on a village-based programmes to strategically engage village in the protection and sustainable management of peatland ecosystems and proactively contributing to its restoration. The objective is to establish village-owned enterprises that sustainably utilize peatlands beyond ecological purposes and support economic welfare of the communities.","The existing undertakings and its future targets and investments address most directly to Sustainable Development Goals 15 (protect, restore, and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss, particularly SDGs 15.1. 
The 3R strategy of peatland ecosystem’s restoration evidently effective in achieving water conservation (increasing the water level) by reducing the surface runoff and increasing the water retention in the canal and the surrounding areas. This water conservation efforts will prevent ground water level to decrease drastically. The peat will not become dry and prone to fire occurrence, which otherwise potentially leads to smog disaster and increase the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere. Such a condition may lead to the increased greenhouse gas emission, which contributes to global climate change. Another impact of decreased ground water level is the increased subsidence rate due to oxidation, consolidation, and compaction of peat. Increased peat subsidence rate will potentially lead to increased risk of flood in the long run and render the peatland to become unproductive.
The restoration of peatland hydrological system are also highlighting the engagement of multi-stakeholders in the Self-Sustaining Peatland Protecting Villages Program or Desa Mandiri Peduli Gambut (DMPG). In 2021, Indonesia has established 119 DMPGs and empower additional 28 DMPGs specifically for post-pandemic economic recovery. DMPG provides a framework to integrate restoration and protection of peatland ecosystems into the development of villages. It serves as a social and institutional enabler to ensure the sustainability of restoration efforts in the field. It advances innovation in the development of demonstration sites, strengthens institutional capacity of the village, provides an innovative financing mechanism to rehabilitate rewetting infrastructures, controls forest and land fires, and creates and/or strengthens local cooperative enterprises to support sustainable peatland-based economies through education, dissemination, and training for no-burning land preparation. As for the deliverables, it is expected:

Indonesia has more than 1500 lakes, accommodate 500 km3 (five hundred cubic kilometers) of water or 72% (seventy two percent) of the total Indonesian surface water. Like in many other countries, lakes in Indonesia have numerous purposes related to human life, such as drinking water, agriculture, fishery, industry, transportation and energy. Lakes also serve important element to balance ecosystem, control of flood, drought and climate change, and habitat of biodiversity, as well as advantages for ecotourism, education and research. 
As a result of increased population, intensified use of land and surface water, other human pressures, and some natural phenomenon, our lakes are being threatened, such as sedimentation, water pollution, eutrophication, and decreasing of biodiversity. In this regard, human activities - which is reflected in community’s livelihood and behavior at the water body and at the catchment area - has a big contribution to the decreasing of the Lake’s ecosystem condition.
Development of the commitment is started by understanding the current states of the Lake’s ecosystem, that is decreasing of the Lake’s condition such as silting and pollution, which cause decreasing of water sources in terms of water quality and quantity, flood and drought, and threat to the freshwater ecosystem biodiversity. Noting the conditions, this commitment development explored problems by understanding the pressures and drivers, and identified that their are related to human activities. A brief analyses showed that the solution requires a community based integrated program, as explained below.
Concerning the situation, this commitment is intended and developed to intervene the occured process, by providing and facilitating a community-based effort, with the aim of saving the Lake’s ecosystem, and increasing of the community welfare as well. In the implementation stages, this commitment combines learning process of the community with a thorough communication, and strengthening contribution of the government, inclusively.

The Caucus will typically and centrally undertake activities in the legislature designed to promote WASH access including the consideration of new laws, stronger regulatory environments, and increased funding (from both domestic and international sources) for WASH services within their constituents. Other responsibilities of the WASH Caucus may include but not limited to educating and informing members of Parliament regarding the positive impact they can have on their state or country’s WASH coverage. The Caucus will also empower those legislators to collaborate with each other and their constituents to prioritize WASH investments that will make families, communities in the state and Nigeria, at large, healthier and stronger.
Considering the stark WASH statistics in Enugu State, Nigeria, Network of Water Rights Initiative (NEWARI) will be piloting the Parliamentary WASH Caucus in the state so as to end water poverty in the state by facilitating adequate WASH budgetary allocations and release, whilst strengthening the progress being made around WASH in environment, healthcare facilities, schools among other WASH-related sectors, in the state.

An example is the water crisis that the Metropolitan Area of Guadalajara suffered in 2021, in which one of its main water supply sources was compromised, so it was urgent to start triggering a paradigm shift in the comprehensive management of water in the state.
The search for decentralized alternatives that apply on the short, medium and long term, for the drinking water supply led to the conceptualization of the ""Rain Nests"" program, which seeks to create a decentralized network of rainwater harvesting infrastructure, increasing thus, water resilience for the inhabitants of homes with greater water vulnerability in the Metropolitan Area of Guadalajara and the interior of the State of Jalisco.
The government of Jalisco seeks to guarantee its citizens the human right to water and sanitation, with the integral management of water resources with a basin vision, which ensures a sustainable and equitable use of surface and groundwater, and allows the conservation of biodiversity and natural resources through the political citizenship of ""water for the future"" with a new focus on water resilience, with the aim of completely changing the way we relate with water, seeking to improve water  access, through the installation of 4,250 rainwater harvesting systems in 2023, under a decentralized water supply, use and storage model; that will add up to 8,800 by the end of 2023.","The installation of these systems reduces water stress from traditional sources of supply, mitigates floods, combats climate change, generates a new culture of water care among citizens, and will form water resilience polygons in urban centers.

The Metropolitan Water Resilience Agenda (ARHM) is a response to this, marking the path that must be followed as a metropolis to comprehensively manage water, and strengthens its capacity to better anticipate and prepare for future contingencies.
Its main objective is to improve the water resilience of the Guadalajara Metropolitan Area, strengthening water management, so that it can face the effects of climate change and the socioeconomic challenges that put at risk the sustainable access of the population, the agricultural sector , and industry to water resources. The content you develop:
- Diagnosis: Current situation of the city's water system and the challenges it faces.
- Resilience Profile: Identification of areas of opportunity to achieve water resilience, considering a Social Forum for feedback from the sectors on the Agenda.
- Development of the Water Resilience Agenda in the AMG.

- Development of an interactive model of the water system to know the relationship of the different parts of the system and make better decisions.
- Green and blue infrastructure training for public servants.
- International dissemination campaign of the Water Resilience Agenda.
The result is then the route to increase metropolitan resilience, through a portfolio of projects under 5 lines of action. Given the multiplicity of actors and the complexity of the projects that make up the RHA, monitoring is key to achieving the objectives and the implementation of each one of them until its final stage. This translates into permanent accompaniment to the responsible instances by the IMEPLAN, as the metropolitan coordination instance, hand in hand with the government of the state of Jalisco. The MAG Water Resilience Agenda is soon to be plublished in the context of the UN 2023 Water Conference.","The Water Resilience Agenda has a direct impact on the sustainable development goals, specifically goal 6 related to clean water and sanitation. The proposed measures expand access to water to populations with water vulnerability and shortages, through rainwater harvesting programs and the implementation of hydraulic infrastructure (6.1 and 6.4). They also contribute to increasing sanitation, improving water quality as well as its reuse, with actions such as the purple reuse lines, expansion of water treatment plants and the recovery strategy of the Santiago River, the most polluted in Mexico (6.3 and 6.6).Finally, the actions also contribute to the energy sustainability of the extraction.
Additionally, all these measures are related to other SDGs such as goal 9, resilient infrastructure, goal 13 related to climate action, and goal 7, energy sustainability.

It builds on a pilot project that was implemented over 2020-2022 by GWP and Cap-Net UNDP, with the support of UNEP and UNDP, and deployed in Argentina, Kazakhstan, and Kenya. Placing particular emphasis on the integration of environmental data into decision-making, the pilot facilitated the training of over 250 professionals, sensitisation of 130 decision makers, and development of 4 action plans to protect and restore priority ecosystems in the three countries, through a multi-stakeholder engagement process.  
To respond to and reduce the threats to freshwater ecosystems and the communities that depend on them, UNEP and GWP commit to support selected countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to monitor and analyse environmental and socio-economic data. This will include data on SDG target 6.6, as well as data that will help identify threats, drivers of change and related social and economic opportunities for management of freshwater ecosystems (restoration and/or conservation).  This will form the basis to co-creatively design corresponding management solutions, institutional, policy and legal arrangements, financial schemes and implementation modalities that galvanize collective action and attract innovative financing, and structure the necessary steps for smooth implementation of these approaches by formalising key partnerships and financial arrangements. 
The collaboration will be structured around two major outcomes:
1.	Improved enabling environment for freshwater ecosystems protection and restoration
2.	Development and implementation of actions in priority ecosystems in the countries 
The initiative is expected to be launched in June 2023, with a duration of 36 months. It will involve UNEP, GWP, and potentially other partners. UNEP will provide strategic direction, provide financial support and technical contributions and will formally invite countries to participate. It will also take forward lessons and results from the countries in its broader action on SDG 6.6. GWP will be an implementation partner and will also contribute financially and in-kind. Delivery at country level will be ensured through GWP's Regional and Country Water Partnerships.","The initiative is designed to directly contribute to SDG target 6.6, which aims to protect and restore water-related ecosystems.

EnR Working Group on Water-Energy Nexus (EnR WEN WG) will be established as a formal working group of the EnR network, the European network of national energy agencies, which aims to contribute to the introduction and strengthening of the water theme and the water-energy nexus in national and European public policies, particularly those that specifically refer to energy and energy-climate, and the respective operationalization in the different European countries represented in the network.
This working group will be formally established this year, in the week following the UN 2023 Water Conference, during the EnR Full Members Meeting that will occur in Berlin by 28th March. 
The interdependences between energy and other resources, particularly water, jeopardizes climate mitigation and adaptation goals, and is driving the energy sector to look beyond energy. Water faces increased shortages due to climate change, and is critical for energy production, including renewables (eg. hydropower, solar, biofuels) and new energy vectors (eg. hydrogen). Additionally, growing competition for water between the energy sector, consumers and other economic activities requires increasing water efficiency and conservation practices in all sectors, as well as mainstreaming alternative water sources, which in turn require high energy input that should be provided by renewable sources. Water use is also associated to significant energy use (water utilities, industries, buildings).
The European Energy Agencies have valuable contributions to the energy sector. The water-energy nexus approach is becoming critical to energy activities, stakeholders, and European targets. Furthermore, it presents untapped opportunities of economies of scope and scale, increasing energy and water savings, impact and return on investment when compared to traditional approaches focused solely on energy or water.
Therefore, proposed main goals for EnR WEN WG are to contribute and advocate for the Water-Energy Nexus approach under current and future European and national policies on water, energy, and climate action, fostering stronger connection between these policies at EU and Countries levels. 
To achieve these goals, EnR WEN WG has the following four main objectives:
•	Exchange information | share experiences and best practices on water efficiency and combined water-energy efficiency; Water-energy nexus in renewable energy; Water reuse and alternative water sources (e.g., desalination); Water and energy monitoring; Impacts of integrated approaches to climate adaptation and mitigation goals
•	Develop knowledge | elaborate studies, surveys, and guidelines regarding water-energy efficient policies/products/services and to identify bottlenecks, barriers, and success factors, aiming at supporting policy instruments, national authorities, and the European Commission
•	Foster opportunities | Joint projects on combined water and energy efficiency, boosting green growth, eco-innovation, and green jobs
•	Create a community | promote dissemination of results and conclusions and involve the community, academia and stakeholders in the implementation processes that can result from the working group.","Addressing water and energy together, and their interconnections within the water-energy nexus, is a key driver to attain SDG, as it leads to enhanced impact of combined water and energy savings versus isolated approaches.
Current separated approaches are hindering public policies, instruments, and practices from fully seizing their role and needed impact to accelerate SDG implementation, particularly Goals 6, 7 and 13, where the WEN working group can direct and actively contribute.
Alongside Europe and European Member States bold ambitions towards net-zero greenhouse gas emissions, the new Sustainable Finance Strategy and the EU Taxonomy are in place to accelerate investments in decarbonization.
However, even though water is recognized as a key driver to decarbonize Europe’s energy production and use (JRC, 2019), water efficiency and new water sources lag behind and are usually set aside from energy efficiency, renewable energy, and climate action policies, goals and investments. The time is now to seize water-energy nexus opportunities alongside the needed investments for EU’s climate-neutral ambition and for EU’s transition to a more sustainable financing framework, where sustainable use and protection of water and marine resources are one of the six environmental objectives to be fulfilled under the EU Taxonomy.  
The new EnR Water-Energy Nexus Working-group (EnR WEN WG) thus focus its approach on water as a key energy efficiency driver, a critical resource for renewable energy, and a vital part of the energy transition and climate action. 
Main actions and outcomes aimed by EnR WEN WG Work Plan 2023-2025 include:
I.	Cooperation and advocacy for WEN in energy and water policies&instruments, contributing to SDG targets 6.4., 6.5. and 13.2, through:
•	Intertwined task forces with other EnR WG (eg. Labelling&Ecodesing, Buildings, Industry&Enterprises) to introduce water efficiency and WEN indicators in European Energy performance of buildings directive, national Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs), Long term renovation strategies, National Building Renovation Plans, EPBD, EU Industrial Strategy, Recovery and Resilience Facility and national Plans, Multiannual Financial Framework 2021–2027 and NextGenerationEU
•	Cooperation on WEN building certification schemes in other EnR countries and related green jobs and green skills (using innovative Portuguese water efficiency standard and rating scheme AQUA+, with trial pilots in other EU countries, in close contact with international examples in the US and Australia)
II.	Data and monitoring, contributing particularly to SDG target 13.3., through:
•	Quantification and proposal of common global indicators, data and infographics on water efficiency and water-energy nexus
•	Observatory on water efficiency and WEN baseline and advances, starting off with Labelling, Smart Financing and Incentives, and Green Jobs
III.	Dissemination, contributing to SDG targets 7.a., 13.2., and 13.3., through:
•	Dissemination of results and conclusions, engaging community, academia and stakeholders in the implementation processes resulting from the working group activities and findings
IV.	EnR studies on new EnR topics relevant to WEN, contributing to SDG targets 6.4., 6.5., 7.a., 13.1, 13.2., and 13.3., addressing:
•	Energy for Water and Water for Energy common indicators, challenges and unexplored opportunities, fostering renewable water and energy sources under an integrated nexus approach.","The WEN WG members can include European Energy Agencies, members of EnR, and other interested parties from public and private bodies committed to energy, water and resource efficiency.

It seeks to strengthen cooperation between member agencies and other European actors on all issues relevant to sustainable energy (energy efficiency, sustainable transport and renewable energy). International comparison and information sharing takes place primarily through eight Working Groups, which are also open to relevant non-member organizations. As well as this exchange of information, EnR Working Groups serve as fora for the conception and implementation of successful common projects within the framework of EU-funded programmes, such as the European Commission’s Horizon 2020 Programme. 
EU’s goal of becoming climate-neutral by 2050 – an economy with net-zero greenhouse gas emissions (GEE), backed by Member states that are increasing their ambitions and anticipating their own roadmaps to net-zero by 2045 (eg. Portugal, Germany) is driving multiple European policies and global funding to target specifically on energy efficiency and renewable energy sources.
Although the interdependencies between water and energy are well known and have become a subject of increasing attention for the scientific and policy communities, the development and implementation of water and energy policies remain largely disconnected at EU and Member State levels (JRC, 2019, Water & Energy Nexus in Europe).  In this context, EnR provides a first point of contact for national energy agencies in EU Member States towards an integrated approach of these two dimensions.
EnR dedicates its efforts towards joint activities where its unique character provides added value at both a European and individual Member State level. It provides a channel for pan-European technical support on matters of energy policy, strategy, evaluation, programme design & delivery and marketing communications. Therefore, all the results, recommendations, reports and tools resulting from these working groups always guarantee upscaling and replicability.
As EnR brings together European Energy Agencies, aiming at promoting sustainable energy best practices, it acts as the ideal fora to address and deepen new topics with relevance and impact on these Agencies role towards SDG, as is the case of the water-energy nexus.
The work plan and objectives of the new EnR Working Group on the Water-Energy Nexus will provide significant contribution, and at a very relevant scale, to the global water challenges and objectives of the Water Action Agenda, Water Action Decade and Climate Action Agenda.",0.25,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.75,1.0,1.0

Historically, the Santiago basin has been a big source of economic development for the country, which has created heavy water pollution overshooting the natural depuration capacity of the Santiago river.
This has detonated public policies for an Integrated Recovery Strategy “Revivamos el río Santiago” with a Human Rights approach to guarantee a clean environment, health and sanitation. 
In order to continue the process of the recovery of the Santiago River Jalisco, we propose the following:
1. Increase sanitation in the Santiago River basin: 
The expansión of the WasteWater Treatment Plant (WWTP) ""El Ahogado"" (q= 1000 lps) will culminate the construction of more than 15 kms of sanitary network just recently build, that complete the subbasin ""El Ahogado"" sanitary coverage to be treated on the latest Mexican Official Norm 001 update, before they discharge in the Santiago River.
Santiago River Basin Sanitation Coverage Percentage: (lps of generated wastewater  / lps of treated wastewater ) * 100 -In the Santiago River Basin
2. Increase energy efficiency in WWTPs to guarantee their long term functioning
One of the many challenges that arise in wastewater treatment is that resources needed for Operation & Maintenance are difficult to provide. Since 2009 - 67 of 122 WWTPs in the basin’s inventory have stopped operation (55%), primarily due to energy cost which on average represents 43.5% of O&M. The implementation of energy efficient equipment and/or clean energy improves energy efficiency and withholds WWTP long term functioning.
Number of WWTP energy efficient equipment and/or clean energy generation systems installed in the Santiago Basin.
3. Increase reused water in the Santiago River basin
Reuse of treated wastewater is one of the solutions to create water sustainability and promote circular economy in wastewater treatment. 
Construction of ""Purple"" Lines for Treated WasterWater reuse = kms, lps
4. Mainstreaming the gender perspective in decision-making spaces
The inclusion of women in decision-making spaces such as the Rescue and Recovery of the Santiago River is fundamental for gender perspective. 
5. Preparation of the 2050 Santiago Plan
In order to continue the river's recovery a unified transversal vision must be set, with a clear objective: The Recovery and Restoration of the Santiago River.
Unifying multiple sector diagnoses, scientific data, academic support, a unique governance mechanism that guarantees inclusion of all stakeholders, that leads the way with clear actions, and a critical route for implementation.

            Breaking the Silence has to end taboos, myths, and mental stigma associated with menstruation and raising awareness on menstruation as a natural and life-giving biological phenomenon so that girls and women can manage their menstruation hygienically",Adolescent girls and women,India,Asia and Pacific,"Menstruation is a normal and natural biological process by all adolescent girls and women, yet it is not spoken about openly causing unnecessary embarrassment and shame. In India, the culture of silence around menstruation compounded by taboos makes it a terrifying experience for most and restricts them from practicing safe menstrual hygiene. Lack of a separate and usable girl’s toilet in schools and a toilet at home leaves adolescent girls and women to face the indignity of open defecation. Safe and effective Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) is a trigger for better and stronger development for adolescent girls and women.
Issues related to Menstrual Hygiene Management:
a.	Stigma, culture of silence and lack of information
b.	Lack of access to sanitary napkins and menstrual absorbents
c.	Absence of support from family and community
d.	Lack of access to water, sanitation and hygiene facilities
e.	Lack of separate and usable toilet for girls and women.
f.	Lack of disposal facilities of sanitary pads and cloths
Our main activities in South India
 (Four Districts from three States in South India: Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka):
•	Awareness campaign among adolescent girls and women on Menstrual Hygiene and health.
•	To increase access and use of quality sanitary pads to adolescent girls and women in rural areas and urban areas of South India.
•	Ensure safe disposal of Sanitary Napkins in an environment friendly manner.
•	Further, eco-friendly biodegradable sanitary pads (made of plant fibres/Jute, banana, pineapple, even corn fibre) are introduced as an advantage of not posing as an environmental hazard. Central and State Governments, Local Self Governments (Panchayats) Rural Development Department, Pollution Control Boards, Local community- households and NGOs, schools and Education department, Parent-Teacher Associations (PTAs )  are involved in this process of Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM).
Scaling up of Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) in India
•	India Government declared Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) as a priority area along with handwashing, ending open defecation and building toilets through the launch of Nirmal Bharat Abhiyan (NBA) in 2012 and followed by the present flagship program of India the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM).
•	Apart from the construction of toilets, it aimed at bringing improvement in cleanliness and hygiene through effective and scientific solid and liquid waste management systems , where the Menstrual Hygiene Management (MHM) was included and funds allocated for solid and liquid waste management were provisioned to implement safe disposal .
•	The Kerala government has decided to grant menstrual leave to female students of all universities and institutions under the state higher education department as part of the government’s commitment to realise a gender-just society. Kerala in southern India is set to become the first state in the country to grant menstrual leave for students. Taking into consideration the mental and physical difficulties faced by female students during menstruation, necessary steps will be taken to implement menstrual leave in all higher education department.","Breaking the Silence has to end taboos, myths, and mental stigma associated with menstruation and raising awareness on menstruation as a natural and life-giving biological phenomenon so that girls and women can manage their menstruation hygienically with privacy and dignity.

            Rapid assessment report of deep groundwater resources on Tanzania to the government",Mainland and Zanzibar,Global Action Plan,Africa,"Tanzania holds vast reserves of freshwater in deep aquifers. With funding from the World Bank between 2006 and 2013, Ruden AS in collaboration with other key players successfully drilled nine deep wells with exceptional flow rates, producing 5 to 20 times more drinking water than shallow wells. The Kimbiji aquifer near Dar es Salaam city alone has the potential to provide water for up to two million people. Despite the discovery, to this day these aquifers have not been developed and the people of Tanzania, both mainland and Zanzibar, remain thirsty while standing just a few hundred meters away from their largest water reserves. Ruden AS, a leading private company in hydrogeology, has joined forces with Global Water Center (GWC), an international non-governmental organization, to tackle the water deficit crisis in Tanzania (mainland and Zanzibar). Together, we are working to promote a science-based and proven solution that will transform the current water situation and ensure access to clean, safe, and sustainable water for all. But we can’t do it alone. Donors, the private sector, civil society, and implementing agencies are welcome to join us in our commitment to establish a sustainable and clean water supply in Tanzania and help achieve food self-sufficiency","Agriculture plays a key role in providing food availability globally, nationally, and locally. Achieving progress towards ending hunger will also require progress on other SDGs.  Among the inputs to food security, access to water (SDG6) is the one that represents the greatest challenge in Tanzania, where 16 million people (28% of the population) still lack access to safe water. Considering the water-related sustainable development challenges in arid regions, utilizing unconventional water resources, such as deep on-and offshore aquifers are an emerging opportunity to narrow the water demand-supply gap.",Global Water Center,"Goal 2, Goal 6, Goal 8, Goal 9, Goal 10, Goal 11, Goal 13, Goal 17",,"Tue, 02/07/2023 - 12:00","Fri, 02/07/2025 - 12:00","The discovery of the Kimbiji Aquifer near Dar es Salaam during drilling operations from 2007 to 2013 confirmed the presence of deep aquifers in Tanzania. Furthermore, there is a significant potential for uncontaminated fresh groundwater to be found in deep rock formations in Zanzibar, beyond the maximum 70-100m depth normally drilled on the islands, and possibly beyond the average maximum 300m depth for water wells worldwide. These unexplored aquifers can provide a new source of the water needed to the population in the Zanzibar region. Deep groundwater has been identified from the analysis of data previously acquired by the Oil & Gas industry. In 1976, a Canadian hydrogeologist working on the CIDA-funded Dar es Salaam Water Master Plan interviewed officials of the Agip drilling crew that just recently had completed the offshore Ras Machuisi-1 well in the Zanzibar Channel. What had puzzled the drilling crew was the fact that the extensive Quaternary sands (500m) had contained fresh water, deep under the Indian Ocean. Nothing to this effect appeared in the subsequent Final Report, but indirectly, the indications from electric logs and other data now seem to confirm the original observation.",0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

In 2022, a group of 111 interdisciplinary researchers from 33 countries (including Ruden AS from the private sector) activated the European Cooperation in Science and Technology Action CA21112 - OFF-SOURCE, to better understand if and how coastal aquifers can be used as a source of potable water and to outline policy guidelines for its sustainable use, including the offshore extension of transboundary aquifers. 
However, researchers alone cannot accomplish this goal. Somalia is a good example of how inter-ministerial and cross-sectoral collaboration, including innovation from the private sector (Ruden AS), allowed the identification of more than 400 Km3 of freshwater stored in deep aquifers, by reinterpreting vintage oil data. These aquifers replenish continuously in the highlands of East Africa and might be the most cost-effective and sustainable solution to water scarcity affecting millions in Somalia.","This action will foster communication and long-lasting collaboration between researchers, professionals, and stakeholders responsible for water resource management in different geographic regions to translate current scientific knowledge into tangible recommendations and future market applications, and to effectively address water management needs in coastal areas.

•	Strengthening the capacity of water and sanitation regulators to support professionalized service delivery through the WHO International Network of Drinking-water and Sanitation Regulators (RegNet), and
•	Accelerating efforts to improve WASH in Health Care Facilities, including through WASH-FIT 
Unless progress quadruples, according to the WHO UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme, billions of people around the world will be unable to access safely managed household drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services in 2030.  In addition, half of health care facilities worldwide lack basic hygiene services with water and soap or alcohol-based hand rub where patients receive care and at toilets in these facilities.  
Regulations are a powerful tool that can be used to improve safe drinking-water and sanitation service delivery. In the absence of regulations, accountability and liability may be compromised, leading to increased risks to public health that may go undetected among consumers until outbreaks of water-borne diseases occur. Even when in place, regulations are not always used to their full potential and best advantage to maximize public health benefits and to ensure sustained, affordable service delivery meeting agreed service levels. WHO will continue to support capacity on health protective water and sanitation service delivery, working with utilities, municipalities and their development partners (i.e. through water and sanitation safety planning) in addition to accelerated action on regulation via RegNet. 
Risk management approaches such as water and sanitation safety planning, and tools such as WASH FIT for improving and sustaining services in health care facilities and water and sanitation sanitary inspection forms, are well-proven and offer even more potential for scaling up. As identified in the SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework, “capacity development, monitoring and evaluation are essential for improving service levels, operating and maintaining technology, increasing job creation in the water sector, and monitoring performance, including at community level.”  
As a guiding principle, Gender Equality, Disability and Social Inclusion (GEDSI) considerations will be integrated within the commitment initiative. 
This initiative will rely on the network of WHO and partner country offices and their stakeholders, including at ministries of health and WASH, and other in-country NGOs/INGOs to deliver tailored professional training and outreach to community members in practical, useful elements of the risk management approaches. This would include conducting training and building a cadre of regulators  to conduct sanitary inspections for small drinking water systems, use sanitation inspection forms for different types of toilets, and supporting health facility staff, particularly female ones, to improve and sustain WASH, waste management and environmental cleaning approaches for primary health care facilities, which serve largely women and children.  Efforts will also support strengthening budgets, financing and investments in women and child appropriate WASH services to ensure that training and regulatory efforts bear fruit. In general, the initiative will complement efforts to progressively achieve professionalized services by working with governments and influencing policies to support a diverse, paid workforce as well as mechanisms which make training institutionalized and sustainable.","The commitment will support:
•	Drinking water and sanitation regulators develop improved capacities to develop, implement, monitor and/or enforce a set of specific rules to ensure drinking water safety and safe management of the sanitation chain, to protect public health.
•	Risk-based quality improvement (WASH-FIT, WSP, SSP) are implemented and monitored, with demonstrated service level improvements across countries

Over the last two decades, floods and droughts have affected more than 3 billion people. Disasters related to weather, climate, or water hazards have caused on average losses of US$ 202 million every day for the past 50 years.[1] 
At the same time, disasters can have significant impacts on water infrastructure, causing damage to treatment plants, reservoirs, and distribution systems and leading to disruptions in the availability of clean drinking water and water supply for other activities, such as cooking, agriculture, and manufacturing processes. 
Enhancing the resilience of water infrastructure and reducing disaster risks is thus paramount to achieving SDG 6 on clean water and sanitation. However, there are major barriers and challenges that have prevented progress in terms of water infrastructure resiliency, such as short-term thinking and planning which externalizes future risk creation, lack of local institutional capacity, inadequate policy and regulatory frameworks and capacity to enforce them, and insufficient investment, to name just a few.

These Principles are now being piloted and implemented at the national level and can be directly applied to the water sector. This work includes consideration of resilience to climate change impacts, contribution to climate change mitigation and adaptation, as well as the role of green, blue and hybrid infrastructure solutions to minimize threats to the water sector, while recognizing the co-benefits provided by water ecosystems.   
A limited understanding of the linkages between infrastructure assets and systems, for instance between water systems and the energy sector, is also often highlighted as a key challenge for strengthening infrastructure resilience.

The details of this investment are included in a separate commitment to the Action Agenda.  Water for Women will continue to strengthen its focus on improving water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) systems and increasing services for everyone in the community, including women, poor and marginalised communities, and people with a disability.
Inclusive WASH is a critical connector for resilience, equipping communities to adapt and respond to increasing climate hazards. Advancing gender equality, integrating climate change risk assessment and adaptation as well as accelerating gender and social norms change is critical to implementation in this extension phase of Water for Women.
In response to this additional investment, the implementing partners of the Water for Women Fund, are strengthening both targeted and mainstreamed gender, disability and social inclusion (GEDSI) strategies that respond to evidence that gendered approaches to WASH can contribute to more effective, sustainable and climate-resilient WASH outcomes. Projects are also addressing the challenge that climate change is not experienced equally, with women and marginalised communities bearing the brunt of negative impacts to climatic events. Partners are integrating learning from delivery of inclusive WASH in the first phase of Water for Women to support communities to build climate resilience in the extension phase.
Water, sanitation and hygiene delivery offers this entry point to facilitate changes in gender relations, norms and attitudes; including beyond the achievement of SDG 6.   Enabling diverse perspectives in decision-making strengthens prospects for more holistic and sustainable solutions to climate-related issues at all levels – from global to local. The knowledge and experience of women and marginalised people contributes to solutions that benefit everyone in the community, not only the few – inclusive WASH is an essential building block of climate resilience.
In this extension phase, Water for Women is committed to building and sharing greater understanding of how climate change will impact GEDSI strategies in WASH delivery and how they can be successfully adapted to maximise the sustainability and equitability of WASH approaches in the varying and challenging contexts of climate change in the Asia Pacific region.
Application of the Rio Markers for climate financing (Principal), the DAC OECD gender markers (Significant) will be used to assess how WASH, climate and gender objectives are being met.
Water for Women is delivered collaboratively by the donor, private sector, civil society, researchers, partner governments, local organisations and communities working collaboratively to create sustainable, equitable and inclusive WASH solutions.
A Fund Partnership Group provides the governance mechanism that will oversee this commitment and ensure that the Fund maintains a shared focus on delivering these commitments – it includes a representative from each of the 20 partners in the Fund.","Water for Women has been improving the health, gender equality and wellbeing of Asian and Pacific communities, and will now systematically integrate climate change considerations into approaches to maximise ongoing sustainability of new and existing WASH systems and services. Contribution to this aim in this extension phase is undertaken through four areas of focus with a particular emphasis on addressing gender and social inclusion for women, marginalised communities and community members:
1.	Strengthening national and subnational WASH sector systems and their linkages to other sectors
2.	Increasing equitable, universal access to and use of sustainable, climate resilient WASH services.
3.	Strengthened gender equality and social inclusion in households, communities and institutions in a changing climate.
4.	Dedicated knowledge and learning processes at both Fund and global levels in order to strengthen use of new evidence, innovation and practice in sustainable gender-sensitive, inclusive and climate resilient WASH.   
Advancing gender equality through implementation of Sustainable Development Goal 6 –Clean Water and Sanitation – will see a world where women and girls do not bear the time burden of walking long distances every day to collect water for their families, where their reproductive health and nutrition status is vastly improved, where fewer babies die as a result of mothers giving birth in unhygienic health care facilities and girls no longer miss school because there are no appropriate menstrual hygiene management services. These are just a few examples which highlight the critical contributions of effective water management and WASH to the health and resilience of women, their families and communities.
In addition to improving g the health and well-being of women and girls, as well as other diverse and marginalised populations, the strategies implemented in Water for Women will also support the creation of leadership opportunities at both community and systems levels. Water for Women has so far supported over 9,500 women to take on leadership roles within the community, government and private sector institutions and will continue to support additional leaders.  By strengthening systems, creating leaders as well as delivering WASH services, the direct and indirect beneficiaries in Water for Women continue to expand.
Research enquiry will continue to be supported through the extension phase together with eminent Australian and International research institutes, recognising that research is a key pathway for development innovation and to inform policy-making and effective program delivery
In this extension phase, the Fund is has integrated a broad set of stakeholders into its projects and research from health and education,  water resource management and climate change  sectors to name a few, as well as a continued commitment to increase the number of partnerships with local rights holder organisations throughout the region to bring diverse voices into decision-making processes.

Mediterranean people (indirect),
Global community (indirect).",Italy,Europe,"Italy is facing increasingly significant water crises affecting vulnerable ecosystems and aquifers, already altered by historical pollution or burdened by considerable human pressure, and water systems with obsolete infrastructures and networks, due to lack of adequate structural and maintenance investments. The evident effects are impacting on the availability and quality of water resources in many territorial circumstances of the country, endangering the balance and livelihood of ecosystems, putting at risk sanitation and health services and the safety of water use for the human and animal consumption, and endangering strategic production sectors, including primary and food production. In a scenario of such extraordinary complexity, the prevention and response actions functional to achieving SDG 6 and other objectives and targets relating to health and water, looking at the entire UN 2030 Agenda, are based in Italy on a partnership for the sustainable development in full line with SDG 17.
A fundamental reform for access to adequate supplies of safe water for human consumption is expressed in the new regulatory framework based on Directive (EU) 2020/2184 on the quality of water for human consumption. Risk analysis as a pillar of the protection of water resources and ecosystems from pollution, control and prevention measures and surveillance of water-related impacts on human health through the entire water supply chain, including distribution in priority buildings, is ensured by a holistic approach with health governance consisting of broad inter-institutional and trans-sectoral partnership, also enhancing communication and information on water and health. The Ministry of Health together with the Ministry of the Environment and Energy Security (MASE) plays a role of guidance and coordination, supported by the Italian Institutes of Health and Environmental Research (ISS, ISPRA) National and Regional, engaging the Regional and Territorial Authorities, and with a pivotal role in the function of the Regulatory Authority (ARERA), in supervising the fundamental cooperation based on due diligence of water suppliers, in the field of technical quality of water and sanitation. The National Statistics Institute (ISTAT) supports the access to data by the general population and monitors the implementation of the SDGs.
A transversal national initiative for water and health, conducted by the Ministry of Health and MASE with the support of ISS, ISPRA and SNPA, is the draft law to implement the UNECE/WHO ""Water and Health"" Protocol that Italy signed on June 17, 1999. This provision would allow the country to include the many activities it already carries out in the water and health sector, in a single and coherent reference regulatory framework, also taking into account the role that Italy is playing for many years in the framework of the activities of the Protocol under the auspices of UNECE/WHO in coordinating the Program “Resilience of water systems to climate change” in co-leadership with the Netherlands.","The actual national scenario and expected trend, as also proved by the increasing multiple water crises in Italy, is undoubtedly indicating that unprecedented environmental and climate determinants are jeopardizing the objective of ensuring access to clean and safe water supplies to everyone.  A new strategy is therefore under developing, based on science-informed policymaking, carried out at governmental, regional and local level, involving the whole water sector, civil society, academia and third sector and encompassing each accelerator areas for water agenda, such as financing, capacity development, governance, data, innovation.
The reform of the legislation on quality of water for human consumption, transposing directive (EU) 2020/2184, ancillary regulatory acts and guidelines is the pillar of the framework through which managing safely drinking water, assuring water quality and enhancing consumer trust.
The introduction of a holistic evidence-based prevention approach, according to the extensive risk analysis from the water catchment environments to the water consumption, considering any effect of human exposure, represents a cultural revolution in collective health prevention policies in the water sector. On the other hand, this ""new approach"" is in line with the evolution of the policies expressed by the Ministry of Health and National Institute for Health, which conceive actions and objectives not only towards the progress of knowledge on the diagnosis and treatment of pathologies but also on research and control for the reduction and control of the negative impact of environmental determinants on health. Through the risk analysis carried out by standardized ""water safety plans"", subjected to National approval, a converging dialogue is achieved with the health leadership for all sectors which, at different levels, influence the objective of ensuring safe and accessible water, according to principles of equity and sustainability. The process promotes, at different level and by different stakeholders, governance of water systems centred on the quality of water and services, investments in infrastructure endorsed through incentives in terms of regulation, development of knowledge and innovation, management and analysis of data through new information systems.
According to the new legislation two essential strategic actions are defined to ensure safely managed drinking water provisions, universal access to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene and enhanced monitoring and efficient management, communication of data, thus guaranteeing access to the information for the public, and the exchange of data and communications between the competent environmental and health authorities and the operators of the drinking water sector.
Firstly, the National Center for Water Safety (CeNSiA) is instituted, divided into four functional areas: microbiological and virological risk; chemical risk; coordination, management and access to data; assessment and approval of water safety plans.
A centralized health information system is also established, called ""Dynamic Territorial Registry of Drinking Water (AnTeA)"", fully interlinked with the environmental system containing the data produced by regional and provincial agencies for the protection of the environment and transmitted to ISPRA by the autonomous regions and provinces.","Regions and Autonomous Provinces,

The basin is home to >4 million Africans, many of whom are vulnerable and directly dependent on the water resources of the Incomati Basin for ecosystem services that supports their livelihoods.  The basin is also recognised as a biodiversity hotspot for aquatic and riparian wildlife where many of the world’s prominent wildlife reserves occur (Incl. the Kruger National Park) and dominated by freshwater ecosystem priority areas, but the water resources of the basin are generally being used excessively and potentially unsustainable","Mozambique, South Africa, Centro de Gestao e Estudos Estrategicos ? Brazil (CGEE)",Africa,"Important shared, transboundary water resources in southern Africa are limited, usually over utilized and unsustainable. These shared resources are dynamic and difficult to manage in a developing regions of the world where human and financial resources, technical capacity and knowledge of dynamic socio-ecological systems is limited.
While we are developing these resources, the vulnerable ecosystems and the human communities,  biodiversity and ecosystem processes that depend on these systems are threatened and suffer from poorly managed multiple stressors. Fortunately, in many parts of the developing world as is the case in the shared Incomati Basin in southern Africa, the availability of ecosystem services and the willingness of stakeholders to come together towards sustainable management of our resources is available.
In the Incomati Basin, from South Africa with Mozambique and Eswatini partners we have established a transboundary sustainable water resources management programme titled: Risk framework for multiple stressors and integrated sustainability management of the trans-boundary water resources of the Inkomati Basin. We aim to establish a probabilistic, risk based water resources management framework that represents causal risk pathways between sources of stressors or anthropogenic activities, water quantity, quality, habitat, disturbance to wildlife and climate change stressors and socio-ecological endpoints that represent what stakeholders care about on a regional spatial scale. This programme has been established to align regional policies, strategies and legislation in the approximately 50 000 km2 Incomati Basin that is home to >4 million people and provide an adaptable trans-boundary socio-ecological management framework. This framework will identify and quantify stressors on multiple spatial scales and provide an evidence based probabilistic risk of the stressors affecting social and ecological endpoints that is both spatially appropriate and liked to represent ecological connections of the shared water resources.  The outcomes will include the characterization of sustainability targets, or resource quality objectives, evidence based risk assessment outcomes of past, present and future risk of multiple stressors to these targets or objectives and sustainability requirements that inform sources of stressors to allow stakeholders to implement resource directed measure legislation in the region.
This programme is the first of its kind in southern Africa and has the potential to contribute to the sustainable management of important social and ecological attributes of the Incomati shared river basin and the region.","We propose to:commit to:
•        Characterise the socio-ecological dynamism of the water resources in the basin. This includes a project on the risk of multiple anthropogenic stressors (flow alteration, water quality pollution, habitat alteration/loss, alien invasive species, over utilisation/harvesting and climate change for example) to the ecosystem services (including supporting services that explicitly considers biodiversity including research on aquatic and riparian plants, invertebrates and fish) on multiple spatial scales throughout the basin. We can commit to the risk assessment outcome by 2025.
•        Establish a risk assessment framework for the sustainable trans-boundary management of the vulnerable water resources, biodiversity and livelihoods of vulnerable human communities in the Incomati Basin. This framework will be integrated into existing South African, Mozambican and Eswatini policy/legislation where the requirements for holistic sustainable water resource management will inform sustainability targets or Resource Quality Objectives and their implementation and or monitoring in the region. We can commit to the establishment of the framework and the integration of the sustainability requirements into resource management and monitoring by 2026.  This will include implementation plans by the three countries to protect and or rehabilitate important ecosystem attributes.

            2026-2030 Action Plan",Stakeholders and the environment along the national and international value chains of Finnish production and consumption.,Finland,Global,"The mission of the International Water Strategy of Finland is to work together towards responsible and equitable water security. Supporting water stewardship action by companies is one of the objectives of the Strategy, and water stewardship commitments and partnerships its implementation means. As a part of the implementation of the Strategy, a goal has been set for Finland and Finnish companies to become the most responsible water stewards in the world by 2030.
The national water stewardship implementation framework was lifted to a new level at the Glasgow COP26 in November 2021 when Finland became a founding signatory of the Fair Water Footprints Declaration along with other global leaders. 
The Declaration signatories commit within the water footprints they have control and influence over, domestically and internationally, to a) Zero pollution and control of diffuse pollution, b) Sustainable and equitable water withdrawals, c) WASH access for workers and local communities, d) Protection of nature, and promotion of nature-based solutions and regenerative agriculture, e) Resilience to floods, droughts and water conflict (including through secure water tenure). The Declaration connects in a novel way government policies, trade relations and water stewardship action by companies along national and international value chains.  
In 2022, Finnish ministries with the support of the Finnish Environment Institute Syke developed a first delivery plan for the Declaration for years 2023-2025. It contains a detailed water accounting, footprint and water risk analysis of priority sectors and trade partner countries, and a legal and policy analysis of the available EU and national steering methods and their further development needs. Building on these analyses the plan details a Theory of Change of how Finland will reach the Declaration targets and lists a variety of actions to be taken by Finnish ministries and partners in the coming years, constituting a Water Stewardship Action Plan for 2023-2025, with outline plans and ambitions for scaling up action until 2030. 
The action in 2023-2025 will focus on 1) committing the priority sectors to water stewardship and new types of collective action, 2) advancing fair water footprints and water stewardship as a part of public procurement and ownership steering by state, 3) advancing fair water footprints and water stewardship in trade- and development policy and projects, and 4) providing R&D&I funding for themes linked to priority footprints and associated development needs. 
The progress of the implementation of the plan will be reviewed annually in conjunction with the International Water Strategy action plans and by the Fair Water Footprints Declaration bodies, and amendments and additional plans until 2030 will be opened to public hearing in 2025.","With four signing ministries, the plan has a strong cross-sectoral approach, therefore contributing to achievement of not only SDG 6 but also other SDGs. Importantly, it places main emphasis on actors and networks outside the traditional water sector, highlighting their water risks and opportunities and constituting a strong business case for companies to act and engage on water.
With Fair Water Footprints Framework, the plan bridges in a novel way Finland and its international water footprint to the producing countries and trade partners, highlighting priority themes for Finland and areas for possible joint action. 
While the plan focuses on Finnish government action, it links closely to private sector, research and development, civil society and consumer roles, in Finland and internationally.","companies, industry associations, research institutes, education institutes, cities and municipalities, civil society organisations; Business Finland, Academy of Finland, Centres for Economic Development, Transport and the Environment; Prime Minister’s Office, Ministry of Education and Culture","Goal 6, Goal 8, Goal 9, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 14, Goal 15, Goal 17",,"Sun, 01/01/2023 - 12:00","Wed, 12/31/2025 - 12:00","Finnish Water Way - International Water Strategy of Finland, available at https://um.fi/publications/-/asset_publisher/TVOLgBmLyZvu/content/finni…

Issue: Balancing conservation and development is a key issue for water resources management. Rural areas represented by river source regions are usually characterized by a harsh environment, fragile ecology, underdeveloped transport network, and sparse population, and protect water sources for downstream water security at the expense of lack of economic development. As a result, these regions are economically backward and face problems in conservation and development. Therefore, water and sustainable development in rural and backward areas deserve more attention.
Measures:
In view of difficulties such as geographical differences, conflict in water allocation, upstream and downstream conservation, and cross-administrative district management, comprehensive measures must be adopted. The measures include increasing financial investment, establishing mechanisms, making technological innovation and carrying out cooperation among departments, etc., and are used properly in combination.
Fiscal measures: Regard government investment as the central fund to promote infrastructure construction, enhance the regions’ development capacity, particularly the benefits from resource development, increase ecological compensation for protection of resource environment, and increase multi-channel international assistance.
Mechanism building: Establish cross-industry and multi-stakeholder coordination mechanism to resolve conflict between funding and policy support for industry departments. Establish a system of ecological compensation for areas concerning sacrifices and benefits for water resources protection, and increase technological guidance and financial support for green development in river source areas and rural areas.
Technological innovation: Strengthen technological innovation and application, and solve the structural conflicts between conservation and development, such as implementing circular economy model, renewable energy development, efficient water conservation, and reduction of waste water in river source areas.
Follow-up mechanism: Establish an evaluation system to evaluate the achievements in water resources protection and balanced development in river basins with the participation of upstream and downstream areas, assess the feasibility and efficiency of measures, and provide reference for management results and policy adjustments.",,"IWHR, IRTCES, UNESCO-IHP, GWP, IAHR, ICID, INBO, UNICEF, AWC",Goal 6,,"Mon, 05/01/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2030 - 12:00",,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.8333333333333333,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

Mediterranean peoples (indirect)
Global community (indirect)",Italy,"Africa, Europe","The specific objective of the project is to contribute to the development and strengthening of watershed governance through the River Contracts (RCs), voluntary-based tools of strategic and negotiated planning, that contribute to the integrated management of water resources, flood risk and local development at catchment and sub-catchment scale.
Indeed, a  RC aims at  integrating  sectoral policies and strategies into a comprehensive, inclusive and effective vision and approach, interconnecting place-based needs and challenges. A RC focuses on merging needs of both environment and citizens.
The framework above described requires a comprehensive strategy capable of combining global and local issues and enhancing the relationship between public administrations and citizens. A RC - referring not only to a water course, but also to a lake, a coast,  an aquifer, a lagoon, etc. - is a technical and financial agreement between public and private parties interested in a comprehensive, concerted and sustainable management of a hydrographic unit. The goal is therefore:
•	strengthening synergies amongst the Action Program (AP) of the RC and the Plan of Measures of the River Basin Management Plans;
•	enhancing the interinstitutional synergy, the multilevel administrative capacity and the local community empowerment in order to facilitate participatory and inclusive decision-making processes;
•	developing models and practices of public-private partnerships
•	raising awareness and disseminating good practices related to the sustainable management of water resources;
•	encouraging the establishment of increasingly responsible and active communities towards the ecological transition and social and environmental sustainability, also involving the younger generations.
The resources, necessary to assist and support the local communities in the preparation of the RCs and in the implementation of their commitments will be granted over several years. This method of progressive investments will allow to support the RCs from the decision-making phase up to the implementation of the Action Programs.
This targeted investment is accompanied by a commitment aimed at monitoring, digitizing and assessing information about RCs using a dedicated National Platform (database).","These are the main expected results at the end of the project: the dissemination and strengthening of participatory processes and the involvement of public-private partnerships for the management and protection of water resources, the defense against risk, together with sustainable local development. The numerical growth of the River Contract processes is therefore expected. Currently in Italy, following an initial national diffusion, there are already about 200 CdF started and almost 70 subscribed and in the implementation phase of their Action Programs. The AP of the CdF, which can be reached through a path of local participation and empowerment, supported by the institutions, contribute to the achievement of the SDG objective on a local scale.
Therefore, through the Action Programs of the CdF, it will be possible to adopt appropriate measures for short, medium and long term needs (improving  of water quality; developing good agricultural and/or production practices with low impact on water resources; supporting sustainable management of water in urban and extra-urban areas also intervening on conflicts of use; promoting integrated management of water resources, reducing citizens' exposure to risks, etc.).
A more participatory management of water resources and the territory with the active participation of local communities will consequently allow:
- a lower influx of pollutants and plastics into the Mediterranean Sea by improving the ecosystems connected to it (SDG 14.1);
- improved water quality and quantity for urban and productive use and increased water efficiency in all sectors in order to address water scarcity (SDG 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, SDG 3.3);
- the conservation, restoration and sustainable management of water-related terrestrial ecosystems, the sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources, together with the strengthening of resilience and capacity to adapt to climate change and the fight against desertification (SDG 15.1 , 15.3, SDG 12.2, SDG 13.1);
- positive economic, social and environmental relationships between urban, peri-urban and rural areas, the implementation of resilient agricultural practices that will increase productivity and production and that will help to preserve ecosystems, the enhancement of territories through sustainable tourism (SDG 2.4 , SDG 8.9, SDG 11);
- the adoption of inclusive policies that guarantee the participation of local communities, the empowerment of women in decision-making processes, contributing to overcoming the gender gap, and fair access to information that could increase awareness and participation in water management.","Eastern Alps District Authority

Researchers estimate that the volume of untapped on-and offshore fresh groundwater is one hundred times greater than the amount extracted from the Earth's subsurface in the 20th century. Recent studies show that deep on-and offshore groundwater might be the most cost-effective and sustainable solution to water scarcity in many costal countries where these aquifers are connected to the surface and replenish continuously. To make unconventional sources of water accessible, innovative solutions from all angles need to be considered. Drawing on the successful case study of deep groundwater in Somalia, Ruden AS as a member of the European Cooperation in Science and Technology Action CA21112 - OFF-SOURCE, commits to promoting inter-sectoral collaboration between the private sector (oil industry and water industry), academia, and research on a global scale, and to assist the inter-ministerial dialogue through water-and-science diplomacy, laying water and science at the center of the discussion.","Achieving the SDGs by 2030 demands new strategies solutions and collaboration to tackle the complex problems. Deep, onshore, and offshore freshwater is an unconventional water resource with great potential, but it also poses great challenges. For example, to date, transboundary aquifers have been addressed only onshore. Outlined policies for offshore aquifers need to be developed. This action focuses on involving interdisciplinary expert parties (the private sector, research, and academia) in efforts to find solutions to complex problems, while working hand in hand with the Civil Society, International support, and Government entities.

Desalination of seawater provides about 70% of potable (domestic) water supply in the Kingdom—and is one of the key six target sectors of the Kingdom to reduce GHG emissions.
SWCC—responsible for desalination—aims to play an effective role in achieving the Kingdom’s climate change commitments and ambitions within Vision 2030. SWCC has developed a program to significantly reduce carbon emissions by 2030.","SWCC is the global leader in desalination and wants to go beyond with increasing energy efficiency, reducing costs, and increasing the sustainability of its operations.  SWCC has estimated that the baseline of total emissions from the production system amounts to 60 MT CO2e annually. By 2024, around 56% of emissions will be reduced, while the remaining 44% is planned to be managed by 2030.
SWCC is gradually replacing conventional, energy-intensive MSF and MED technologies with lower-energy-consuming RO technology. Further, the plants will be supplied with electricity from sources that reach 43% efficiency for the combined cycle power systems, and they have plans for capturing and reusing energy. This switch reduces the energy consumption per cubic meter of potable water generated from 15 kWh/m3 to just 3 kWh/m3—an 80% reduction, which will reduce 25 MT CO2e annually (42% of total SWCC emissions).
SWCC is making swift progress in the replacement. To date, eight of the 13 thermal desalination plants—which together produce 94% of the water from thermal desalination plants—are either already replaced with RO or currently under construction and scheduled to be completed, at the latest, by 2024. The largest plants include Jubail (1 million m3/year), Khober Phase 2 (630K m3/year), and Shuqaiq Phase 1 (600K m3/year).

Even today, water stress has a real effect on people’s livelihoods, the economy and GDP growth. The impact of water stress is further aggravated by water pollution, making scarce resources unfit for usage, insufficient and infrastructure and non-revenue water. 
However, countries can take actions to address water stress and ensure their long-term water security. Actions include measures to either reduce water demand or to increase water supply. These are anchored in national, river basin, or utility planning documents and driven by the legal and regulatory environment of the country.","The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia—one of the most water-stressed countries in the world—is taking a range of measures to ensure their water security as a foundation to achieve the socioeconomic transformation they target as part of Vision 2030. The Kingdom is (1) reducing water demand by optimizing water usage in agricultural production, (2) increasing water supplies by increasing desalination and strategic storage capacity as well as increasing usage of treated wastewater, and (3) increasing water system resilience by increasing transmission and interlinkage projects as well as by enhancing portfolio planning and water system monitoring. 
Ensuring water security is a continuous effort, and mechanisms need to be in place to allow for monitoring water systems and assessing any potential threats to water security. With increasing water stress across the world, water will soon emerge as a key limiting factor to socioeconomic development, giving countries that have invested in creating a water-resilient system a competitive advantage.","Ministry of Environment ,Water and Agriculture (MEWA).","Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 9, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 14","2.3, 2.4 , 2.5, 2.a, 3.9, 6.1 , 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 7.1 , 7.2, 7.3, 7.a, 9.4, 12.2, 12.4, 12.6, 13.1, 13.2, 14.1","Wed, 01/01/2020 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2024 - 12:00",,0.875,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05494505494505515

            Watering and management of a significant number of wetlands, rivers and creeks",,Australia,Asia and Pacific,"The NSW Irrigators’ Council is the peak industry body representing irrigation farmers and communities in the state of NSW, Australia. We recognise that our irrigation industry has an important role to contribute to all the UN Sustainable Development Goals, such as Goal 2 (zero hunger), Goal 6 (clean water and sanitation), Goal 8 (decent work and economic growth), and Goal 12 (responsible consumption and production). Recently, partnerships with the irrigation industry – such as Irrigation Infrastructure Operators (IIOs) – has demonstrated success in using irrigation infrastructure to deliver environmental water to wetlands, on both public and private lands. This contemporary approach is critical to Integrated Water Resource Management, particularly in areas like the Murray-Darling Basin which host a mosaic landscape of deeply interconnected land and water users. With 93% of the Basin’s 30,000 wetlands on private property (largely on farmland), partnerships are key to wetland conservation and management. In particular, voluntary partnerships between the private sector, and Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder (the public holding of environmental water purchased from farmers, in addition to river flows) provide an innovative way forward. With environmental water holders now holding 1 in 3 litres of previous irrigation water (in addition to river flows), there is enormous potential to build on already demonstrated success. So far, Murray Irrigation Limited has delivered over 205 gigalitres of environmental water to wetlands, ephemeral creeks and rivers within their footprint since 2001. Murrumbidgee Irrigation has delivered over 11 gigalitres of environmental water since 2015 including to Ramsar-listed sites within their delivery network. Coleambally Irrigation has undertaken 33 environmental watering over 13 sites since 2015, including to areas of the Coleambally Irrigation Biodiversity Reserve to protect Superb Parrots, Southern Bell Frogs and Bunyip Birds. Renmark Irrigation Trust has delivered over 2 gigalitres to inundate 12 sites over 120 hectares since 2017. There are also many examples of individual farmers who privately water wetlands. There is significant potential to take this further. By expanding voluntary partnerships, both existing and new, and with both IIOs and private landholders, environmental watering and management can occur much further into the mosaic landscape. Further, by accompanying this environmental water delivery with complementary on-ground measures, including drawing upon First-Nations knowledge, enhanced outcomes can be achieved.","Expansion of partnerships with IIOs and private landholders better realises Integrated Water Resource Management – i.e. the interconnected management of land, water and related resources, including people. Specifically, it enables environmental water to be best used, by reaching sites further into the landscape, and accessing sites on private land. It also provides a climate change adaptation measure, as a pathway to water sites that may receive less natural inundations with a changing climate altering flow regimes. To demonstrate what’s possible, the proposed Murray Reconnected Floodplains project – by Murray Irrigation Limited (a large private irrigation water delivery company, delivering water to 2,124 landholdings across 724,00 ha in the Southern Basin) - provides one case study. The Murray Irrigation water delivery system is geographically placed to deliver targeted environmental water to thousands of hectares of rivers, creeks and wetlands that connect to the Murray River. The Project seeks to upgrade existing water delivery infrastructure (escapes, access structures and fence crossings) within the region’s rivers, creeks and wetlands to create a large scale connected ecosystem. The expected outcomes include delivering 600 gigalitres of water for environmental outcomes alongside on-ground initiatives, to rehabilitate and rejuvenate: • 2,000 on-farm private wetlands (54,000 ha wetland area), • 2,000km of riparian systems (20,000 ha of riparian beds), and • 74,000 hectares of floodplain ecosystems. Murray Irrigations modernised supply network will enable precise control and measurement of water, enabling targeted environmental outcomes and demonstrating full accountability of public water – including to target at-risk ecosystems. This provides a modern, precision method of environmental watering. This also enables landholders and people within the community to be actively involved in environmental management, creating a sense of ownership, collaboration, and participation – key to overcoming trust deficits, and rebuilding confidence in water management. Similar initiatives to this case study could occur for other IIOs and private landholdings. The extent of what’s possible cannot be underestimated. Within the NSW Basin alone, the extensive network of irrigation channels across IIOs spans over 6000 km to service a delivery area of approximately 1.8 million ha, covering not just agricultural land, but important environmental assets too. This is in addition to the many private landholders outside these IIO footprints, such as private diverters. Through effective partnerships, landscape-level change can be achieved. This action primarily targets SDG 6.5. In the Murray-Darling Basin, significant water reforms have occurred over recent decades – including establishing Sustainable Diversion Limits (with total diversions for agriculture, town water supplies and other industries combined now just 28% of inflows), through the recovery of 1 in 3 litres of previous irrigation water being transferred to the Commonwealth Environmental Water Holder. Following these water management reforms, the next steps need to be on the integrated components - i.e. the related land and other resources (people) to optimise the water management outcomes. Furthermore, this commitment contributes to SDG 6.b - this participatory approach not only enables better environmental outcomes, but contributes to rebuilding confidence and trust amongst communities through their direct involvement.",A range of Irrigation Infrastructure Operators (IIOs) and a large number of private landholders.,"Goal 6, Goal 12","6.5, 6.b , 12.2","Sat, 01/01/2022 - 12:00","Sun, 06/30/2030 - 12:00",https://murray-irrigation.multiscreensite.com/project/murray-reconnected-floodplains https://www.murrayirrigation.com.au/private-property-wetlands-watering-project-ppwwp/ https://www.murrayirrigation.com.au/water/projects/environmental-2/,0.25,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

The concept of ""sustainable development"" has been formed after substantial discussions on environment and development, while ""disaster resilience"" has been created through the transformation of disaster response. The number of water-related disasters, such as floods, cyclones and droughts, has been rising very rapidly, by more than three times since 1980. The overall economic losses have also been increasing at a fast pace. More than three-quarters of the economic losses are accounted for in upper-middle- and high-income countries. However, the economic losses relative to GDP are higher in lower-middle- and low-income countries. Furthermore, more than 80% of the human losses have occurred in lower-middle- and low-income countries. Throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, the world has learned that complex, cascading and systemic risks that usually lurk in social, economic and environmental systems can suddenly emerge and threaten humanity beyond boundaries in space and time. This realization has posed an existential question: How should humanity survive such risks and live with them in a sustainable way? Responding to the request from the Leaders of the Participating Countries in the 4th Asia-Pacific Water Summit (APWS4) held in Kumamoto in April 2022, leaders, experts, scientists, and all other participants at the APWS4 discussed this question in view of the spirit of the Kumamoto Declaration. The results of the discussions were summarized in the APWS4 Chair’s Summary using three keywords: “water cycle consilience,” “facilitators,” and “end-to-end approach.” In line with this context, ICHARM will advocate and lead the development of the “Water Cycle Integrator (WCI),” which consists of the three functions of knowledge integration, capacity integration, and process integration, in cooperation with other UNESCO Category 2 Centers and Charis as follows: ・ Knowledge integration: The WCI promotes “water cycle consilience” by integrating the knowledge of water cycle, climate, agriculture, and energy using well-organized observation, modeling, and data and information systems based on the Open Science policy. ・ Capacity integration: The WCI fosters the integration of ""facilitators"" to work as catalysts capable of providing expert advice based on a broad range of scientific and indigenous knowledge about climate change in the local context. Facilitators can bridge the gaps between the scientific society and local stakeholders, support education and training, and inform ways leading to practical solutions. ・ Process integration: The WCI establishes cross-sectoral frameworks at local, national, regional, and global levels to link cutting-edge science beyond disciplines with on-site decision-making and action using an “end-to-end approach.” The WCI will be promoted as part of the Kumamoto Initiative for Water. Its activities will be reviewed and evaluated under the UNESCO IHP-IX.","Seventeen sustainable development goals (SDGs) have been identified. Several goals, including poverty, health, education, and labor, represent the quality-of-life component, which is directly supported by the water-food-energy-nexus component. The natural- and artificial-environment components are also connected with the quality-of-life and water-food-energy-nexus components. All these components are deeply related to the social-system component. Water-related disasters intensified by climate change can affect various aspects of society. The impacts propagate to the water-food-energy nexus and the quality of life. Moreover, once society falls into such circumstances, more problems will arise in such areas as gender, equality, and peace to a great degree. Given the interlinkage structure among the SDGs and water-related disasters, the way forward can be found only through discussion and effective problem-solving, employing a cross-sectoral decision-making process based on scientific evidence across national, regional, and cultural boundaries. The outcome document of the High Level Panel on Water (HLPW) convened by the United Nations and the World Bank Group contributes to achieving the multiple SDGs that also depend on the development and adequate management of our planet’s water resources and consequently achieving the 2030 Agenda. The document has also endorsed the formulation of ""Platforms on Water Resilience and Disasters"" involving all stakeholders in countries to facilitate dialogue and scale up community-based practices. ICHARM has been cooperating with several countries in Asia, including Indonesia, Myanmar, the Philippines, and Sri Lanka, to establish platforms and activate their activities. To promote coordination between water-related disaster risk reduction and the water-food-energy nexus in the platforms, ICHARM has already developed several functions of the WCI and applied them to various areas around the world. These functions cover flood early warning, dam operation support to improve flood control and power generation, agricultural drought monitoring and prediction, and climate change impact assessment. In cooperation with all levels of stakeholders in Davao City, the Philippines, ICHARM has developed basin- and barangay-scale hydrological models capable of real-time flood forecasting and climate change impact assessment to identify intensified flood risk under the future climate. Co-designed e-learning workshops were also held to foster facilitators. Despite the challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic, UNESCO and ICHARM have prototyped a flood early warning platform and built the capacity for cross-sectoral coordination among experts and leaders from 11 countries in West Africa. Based on these pioneering efforts, the WCI will be further improved and applied at local, national and regional levels as part of the Kumamoto Initiative for Water in cooperation with member states and other UNESCO Category 2 Centers and Chairs. In addition, this WCI project is closely related to the activities of the Crosscutting Working Group on “Hydrological systems, rivers, climate risk and water-food-energy nexus” of the IHP-IX.","UNESCO-IHP, UNESCO Category 2 Centers, WMO, UNDRR, UNU, IAHS, IAHR etc.","Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 4, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 8, Goal 9, Goal 10, Goal 11, Goal 13, Goal 15, Goal 17",,,,,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.9340659340659375

We have set out to improve sanitation and hygiene for 100 million people around the world by 2025 through the introduction of innovative and affordable toilet and hand hygiene solutions. SATO Toilet Solutions are a range of simple and aspirational, yet affordable, toilets and connection systems designed for use in rural and urban areas lacking access to reliable sanitation. Flushing requires less than one liter of water, using a counterweight trapdoor that otherwise remains closed to reduce odors and prevent insects, such as flies, from spreading bacteria. The original SATO model was developed based on the needs of communities in Bangladesh and production and sales began in the country – SATO’s first market – in 2013. SATO products are currently manufactured in six countries of Asia and Africa. Diverse Products Tailored to Local Needs: We now offer an increasingly diverse range of SATO products to reach a broader range of customers’ needs and create a sustainable social business. These include the traditional SATO Pan for constructing latrines, the Flex Pan for more affordable retrofit, and the SATO Stool to help engage children, older people, or people with physical challenges. SATO’s Connection Systems for offset pit latrines, the I-Trap and the V-Trap, enable rapid installation and make it easier to achieve safely managed sanitation. In India, for example, where the government promoted a twin-pit system, we developed the V-Trap toilet system to address local problems of clogging and time-consuming installation. By replacing the traditional, fixed approach to installation with an adjustable V-shaped unit that also uses our unique trap door, the V-Trap toilet enables fast, reliable installation of a twin-pit latrine. That, when combined with a SATO toilet, reduces the risk of clogging and requires approximately 80% less water per flush than conventional toilets. Twin-pit latrines built with SATO are an affordable and effective way to achieve safely managed sanitation in India, and in broader markets. SATO Tap was developed in FYE2021 as an affordable handwashing solution for use in the home or local community to help prevent the spread of COVID-19. SATO Tap uses water in a plastic bottle of various shapes and sizes and uses gravity to release a minimal but stable water flow. As little as 100ml is needed for each hand wash, which is 90% less water than needed with a traditional tap. With a plastic base and nozzle that can easily be manufactured, its simplicity helps keep production costs and retail prices low. Plastic bottles are typically easy to access and, as the SATO Tap promotes their reuse, this product also helps reduce plastic waste.","To date, approximately 6.5 million units of SATO’s innovative sanitation and hygiene solutions have been distributed to 45 countries, contributing to better sanitation for an estimated 35 million people (as of June, 2022). However, we cannot achieve the desired impact through product innovation alone. SATO uses a comprehensive approach that extends to the training of local masons and entrepreneurs, and to the development of reliable local manufacturing and distribution capabilities under our Make-Sell-Use business model. We also pursue imaginative outreach methods for raising awareness of global sanitation and hygiene challenges among people in urban and rural areas with the most urgent needs, building sustainable frameworks that help improve sanitary environments and quality of life and empower rural entrepreneurship. Nurturing Human Capital and Rural Entrepreneurship through SATO Operations: In addition to product innovation, we collaborate with local manufacturers and NGOs to build regional production capacity and sales systems, and nurture local human capital to maximize the benefits and impact of SATO product installations. We do this through our Make-Sell-Use business model that seeks to create sustainable local sanitation economies by fostering rural entrepreneurship, generating regional employment, and facilitating continuous local improvements. The training of local masons and plumbers who install SATO toilets is key. To date, more than 19,000 people, including women and young people, in India, Uganda, Nigeria, Tanzania, and other countries have participated in free training programs designed in conjunction with NGOs and international organizations. These training programs are generating improvements in toilet installations and income. We have also started leveraging digital platforms not only to continue mason training during the pandemic, but also to drive demand for rural mason marts and for our local retailers and partners as we seek to engage more people in greatest need of improved sanitation in rural and urban communities.","Leveraging Global and Local Partnerships to Maximize Community Value: Partnerships are essential for maximizing the impact of our sanitation and hygiene products and marketing and sales activities. We benefit from the strengths of various global organizations, specialist organizations, NGOs, and business partners to help us tailor products, build local production and network hubs, and drive market demand through skills training, sales promotion, and awareness building. UNICEF: In FYE2022, LIXIL expanded our MAKE A SPLASH! global partnership with UNICEF to tackle the sanitation challenge in India, Indonesia, and Nigeria, three of the world’s most populous countries. This expansion complements the original partnership launched in FYE2019 which reached 2.9 million people in Ethiopia, Kenya, and Tanzania. The partnership aims to collaborate on new product lines, leverage financing to support local sanitation economies, and to support policy and regulations that strengthen the sector. In Tanzania, we have been cooperating on a government-driven campaign to ensure universal toilet access by 2025. In India, we installed SATO toilets under UNICEF’s #FlushTheVirus campaign to support healthcare professionals during the COVID-19 pandemic. We also collaborated on SATO Tap prototype tests in Bangladesh, India, Tanzania, Kenya, and Ethiopia, enabling us to commercialize the product based on feedback from potential users and retailers. USAID: Building on the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed in October 2020, LIXIL and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) launched a new five-year cooperative agreement, the Partnership for Better Living (PBL), in October 2021 to improve sustainable access to basic sanitation for two million people by 2026 through the deployment of SATO toilets and SATO Tap handwashing stations in up to 11 countries in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. The PBL is LIXIL’s first direct partnership with USAID, who will co-invest $10 million. JICA: LIXIL and JICA, leveraging their strengths, are working together to improve sanitation and secure access to safe water in developing countries. Since FYE2021, we have been working together in India to raise awareness of hygienic practices such as handwashing. We also collaborated with JICA in FYE2021 to provide a webinar on global sanitation and hygiene to government officials involved in public health from five African countries. Thanks to our partnership work with the agency, JICA officially recognized LIXIL as a JICA-SDGs Partner for our efforts to help achieve the SDGs. BRAC, PSI, and Other NGOs: We work with experienced NGOs, such as Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee (BRAC) in Bangladesh and Population Services International (PSI) in Kenya, to build the value chains that enable SATO installation, to lobby governments to promote sanitation measures, and to receive feedback on product development. Toilet Board Coalition: LIXIL is a member of the Toilet Board Coalition, a global alliance of public and private sector partners that aims to develop sustainable solutions to the sanitation crisis. As co-founder of the Toilet Board Coalition, we have served as chair, and we are now assisting with the running of the organization, mentoring entrepreneurs who tackle sanitation problems, and engaging in advocacy.","Goal 3, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 9, Goal 17","3.2, 3.3, 5.5, 6.2, 6.3, 6.b","Wed, 01/30/2013 - 12:00","Wed, 12/31/2025 - 12:00",USAID Partnership for Better Living: https://www.globalwaters.org/content/partnership-better-living UNICEF Make a Splash!

Responsibilities, reporting structures, investments, recovering costs and financing are being clearly defined. Infrastructure, investment and financing: The water sector offers services to all. A substantial part of its activities is already sustainable and in line with the SDGs. However, more investment is needed across the continent if we want to fully achieve these goals 100%. The cost recovery principle must be fully implemented (mainly through tariffs) and must take long term investment needs into account. The other two elements of the 3 T’s - taxes and transfers - can provide further financing. Ensuring fair access to water services for all, including future generations, should guide all water policy, including long term investments. This requires a fair price to be paid by water consumers for the services provided. In addition, stakeholders whose activities can have a negative impact on water resources and drive the investment costs of water operators should also contribute financially, according to the Polluter Pays Principle and user-pays principle. Innovation has always been and will always be a core activity of water service providers: The SDGs can drive innovative policies towards offering access to drinking water and sanitation to all. Clearly, new solutions to providing services, especially for those people living in remote and rural areas, and difficult-to-reach groups, is key for delivering mainly SDG 1.","Across Europe, access to drinking and waste water services is very good. Maintaining and upgrading infrastructure will be key to delivering the goals. The water sector is improving his proper investment to ensure that its infrastructure is robust enough and fit-for-purpose to deliver safe water and sanitation to all.

            Water Resilience Assessment Framework (WRAF) used in 10 countries","Basins, countries, regions, cities, local communities, freshwater and freshwater dependent ecosystems",Global,Global,"AGWA is a network of individuals and organizations that works in both the technical and policy spheres of water and climate change. In both cases, AGWA crowdsources the best practices, recommendations, frameworks, and policy recommendations through our network and beyond to ensure that our water resources can become climate resilient. One of the core beliefs at our founding was that water is the medium of most negative climate impacts. What we have come to know from a decade of intense collaboration, north and south, is that water is also the medium for most climate resilience. Two basic challenges for addressing climate change exist relative to the SDGs. First, even if we stopped all carbon emissions today, the climate would continue to evolve for many decades — if not longer. This means that any specific targets for 2030 will have a limited shelf life. Second, our ability to estimate with confidence how future climate will evolve, especially concerning the water cycle, is limited. We believe these challenges force us to consider how to address the prospect of climatic transformation, which is when a region develops fundamentally new climatic, hydrological, and ecological characteristics. Globally, we see transformation already well underway in high-latitude and high-altitude regions, such as when we lose a glacier and we see a grassland or even a forest emerge. Within a decade or two, we can expect that most regions of the planet will be well along the path of transformation. The issue of transformation is one that has yet to be adequately addressed by the global water community; our traditional solutions based on optimization and hydrologic stationarity do not match the issues that climate change presents. While we must urgently accelerate and complete our energy revolution, we must simultaneously learn to live with the expectation of ongoing change — to prepare and to ensure that we find ways to thrive and build prosperity. In other words, we must build our collective resilience using new tools and approaches to live with complexity, change, and uncertainty. Water resilience is the concept that we must act robustly and decisively for the impacts we can see with confidence, while planning for flexibility for impacts that we cannot predict with confidence. Water resilience does not assume that the past predicts the future. This approach applies to infrastructure as much as regulatory frameworks, protected areas, and global governance. Water resilience should be the key to locking in many SDG targets to ensure they remain relevant beyond 2030. Our situation is serious, but we also have reasons to be hopeful. The concept of water resilience remains relatively new but is rapidly expanding. Many institutions are now working in this space, but many of the most important stakeholders are not necessarily found within the traditional water community. How do we reach new audiences? This is AGWA’s principal commitment to the Water Action Agenda: to mobilize and engage a global water resilience community dedicated to transforming the ways we govern, manage, utilize, and thrive with water.","Under this overarching commitment, AGWA has several initiatives to contribute, framed around the levers of the SDG6 Global Acceleration Framework. Specifically, we commit to expanding and deepening our work on optimized finance, capacity development, innovation, and governance for water resilience. Capacity Development The need for increasing capacity and training around water resilience is critical, especially for regions with advanced transformation. Much of the capacity work targets innovation in resilience. In 2018, with AGWA support, UNESCO published the Climate Risk Informed Decision Analysis or CRIDA approach. This is a climate risk reduction methodology that is tolerant of limited data, uses simple software, and helps technical decision-makers engage with stakeholders to develop shared resilience solutions. By 2030, UNESCO has pledged to support CRIDA’s implementation in all of its member countries and to translate the guidance and case studies into all official UN languages. Related to both capacity building and governance, since 2018 AGWA has been collaborating with the UNFCCC to train national climate adaptation focal points in the basics of water-centric adaptation and resilience. Now called the CASTT Adaptation Academy, we partner with IHE-Delft, the Asian Institute of Technology (AIT), Oregon State University, and Korea Environment Institute for three weeks of in-person intensive training. This work has already reached about 75 countries; by 2030 we commit to doubling that number to 150 countries. Innovation Launching last August with groups such as the Pacific Institute, IWMI, and WRI, we have co-developed an approach called the Water Resilience Assessment Framework or WRAF. WRAF is intended to accelerate corporations and utilities into water resilience. WRAF is a very bold, innovative approach that should have a promising, long lifespan. We hope to see WRAF used in at least 10 countries by 2030. Governance In line with the SDG6 Global Acceleration Framework, AGWA believes that if water is the medium of resilience, water must also rise above being a sector and become a connector. Resilience is a shared property, and developing a level of systems awareness and thinking is central to governing for resilience. AGWA has developed a program called the Water Tracker for National Climate Planning, through which we have been working with national governments to help them actively navigate and see the water-climate risks and synergies across and within ministries. Over the next five years, we will expand this initiative with a new set of global partners that will allow us to deepen our engagement with 50 countries in supporting water-resilient national climate planning. Optimized Finance At the UN Water Conference, we will also launch Enabling Resilient Economies: A Blueprint for Catalyzing Prosperity and Structural Transformation Through Water Resilience, a publication aimed at macroeconomists, finance ministries, and central bankers. We have long managed our national economies for efficiency and stability, but these concepts are profoundly threatened by climate change and other risks, as shown by recent shocks from covid, supply chain disruptions, and even unforeseen political and social risk. Our goal is to provide evidence and guidance to economists that shows how to operationalize resilience.","AGWA works with dozens of partners on these and other water resilience initiatives including governments such as The Netherlands, Spain, Germany, the UK, and Egypt; IFIs such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank; NGOs and research institutions such as Deltares, Global Resilience Partnership, Forest Trends, The Nature Conservancy, Alliance for Water Stewardship, and the International Water Management Institute; UN Conventions and Agencies like the UNFCCC, UNDRR, UNESCO, and UN Global Compact; as well as private entities such as Veolia, Microsoft, and Arup. We believe that no one of us is smart enough, rich enough, or powerful enough to adapt in isolation. Indeed, becoming resilient together is in the true spirit of the SDGs and the UN Water Conference itself. We look forward to welcoming you!","Goal 2, Goal 6, Goal 9, Goal 11, Goal 13, Goal 15","2.4 , 6.5, 6.6, 9.1, 9.4, 11.5, 11.6, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.b, 15.1",,,"For CRIDA: https://en.unesco.org/crida For WRAF: https://ceowatermandate.org/resilience-assessment-framework/ For CASTT Adaptation Academy: https://unfccc.int/castt-adaptation-academy For the Water Tracker: www.watertracker.cc For Water Resilience for Economic Resilience: https://www.alliance4water.org/wr4er For additional water resilience tools and approaches that AGWA is involved in, including our podcast ClimateReady: www.agwaguide.org",0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

Its sustainable, fair, and efficient management requires dedicated and qualified professionals, who have both the necessary expertise and enjoy the trust of the water users.
A stronger commitment to both gender equality and social inclusion is needed in the water sector for sustainable management and development. Women have critical roles to play in water resources management and protection. Despite the evidence that engaging women in water governance is good policy, a gender gap persists in the water sector. Participation of Women in key decision-making processes or participating in initiatives connected to water whether, at the local, institutional, or political level is very low or scarce. When women are included, they often confront major obstacles including male resistance and stereotypical perceptions that women lack the ability to engage in technical discussions.
At first glance, water management might seem like a technical issue that lacks a gender perspective. However, as women and men have different roles and responsibilities in a society, they also have different knowledge and experience in relation to the management of water.
Water scarcity in Ethiopia proves to be a burden for women, causing them to sacrifice work, education, money, and providing for their families. Many do not have a choice but to make the long treks to retrieve clean water, but several organizations use their resources and funds to build water sources for Ethiopians.
The Ethiopian Women in Water Association overarching objective is creating a platform to share ideas, empower women professionals in the water sector, facilitate exchange of experience and opportunities, provide a platform for networking, and ultimately contribute to gender balance and diversity in the sector. The members are committed to facilitating the inclusion of women in water and climate discussions that will lead to better decision-making and improved resource management. 
The Specific objectives are Strengthening the capacity of women engaged in the water sector - by providing capacity building trainings; To facilitate the platforms where the members of the association can meet each other and exchange experiences; Working in coordination with various associations engaged in the water sector in the world and sharing their experience with the members; also, integrating the local experience with the global one and turning it into practice; To help women professionals working in the water sector to participate in international water, hydro-diplomas, transboundary river cooperation; Providing new information on job opportunities for members living in the water sector; Studying the barriers to women's participation in the sector, identifying and implementing issues that are prioritized together; Facilitating forums for solution-oriented discussions in the field; Promoting the professional activities of women in the field; Develop joint consultation forums in coordination with other stakeholders; and Coordinate non-profit projects that reach out to the community.","Water is a strategic resource and an essential element of security.

Our organisational pledge is to raise and invest US$2 billion by 2030 to extend the impact of our WASH work across 50 countries in six regions, with an emphasis on reaching the world’s most vulnerable, especially in fragile contexts. World Vision will directly reach more than 30 million people with safer, more accessible water, 30 million people with dignified sanitation, and 35 million with improved hygiene in this period. Achieving universal access to safely managed WASH services by 2030 will require an increase of four times the current rates of progress, and in fragile contexts, it would need to accelerate by a factor of 23 (WHO/UNICEF, 2021). This can only be achieved through an evolution in the sector. To drive progress toward SDG 6, World Vision is committed to leading the WASH sector in the transition away from community wells with hand pumps toward sustainably managed piped-water networks. This will entail strong collaboration and capacity building with communities and local and district governments for proper governance of these systems, including co-financing of projects and equitable cost-recovery systems to support ongoing maintenance. World Vision is committed to reaching the most vulnerable through our WASH programming, and there are several ways we do that (partnerships, behaviour change practices, strengthening governance and finance, water security and resilience programming, etc.). Two key approaches we use to reach the most vulnerable are by working in fragile contexts and using a gender equality and social inclusion (GESI) approach. Through our five-year business plan, 85% of planned funding is directed toward sustainable WASH development work in fragile or extremely fragile countries. Successful WASH interventions in fragile contexts must address a broad spectrum of needs by vulnerable populations who are affected by conflict, displacement, political and economic instability, climate change and recurring natural disasters, and disease outbreaks. Across fragile contexts, World Vision has increased focus on building resilience to complex shocks to break the cycle of poverty and reduce recurrent need for humanitarian assistance. World Vision lays the groundwork for long-term sustainability during short-term, emergency responses while addressing immediate, lifesaving needs. And we continue to work with communities through long-term WASH development programmes to support recovery and build resilience. Meaningful participation and leadership by women, people with disabilities, and other marginalised groups remains a key challenge in global WASH programming, resulting in services that often do not meet their needs. World Vision’s commitment to GESI-transformative WASH promotes equal and inclusive access, decision-making, participation, and well-being of the most vulnerable. This involves transforming systems, social norms, and relations to enable the most vulnerable to participate in and benefit equally from development interventions. It also involves working to change underlying social structures, policies, and broadly held social and cultural beliefs that perpetuate inequalities. Ultimately, the goal is to promote the empowerment and well-being of vulnerable children, adolescent girls and boys, their families, and communities for all people to thrive.","World Vision is committed to supporting the global effort to track progress toward universal and equitable WASH services for accountability toward achievement of SDG 6, in alignment with JMP protocols. We are scaling up digital monitoring and mapping practices that help us track the reach, quality, and sustainability of our work. World Vision is embracing spatial mapping technologies to help ensure we reach everyone, including the most remote communities that are often overlooked. This enables us to precisely plan investments, monitor progress, and demonstrate achievement of universal WASH service coverage, community by community. The impact of our US$2 billion WASH investment will be multiplied by leveraging our organisational distinctives to increase our reach and effectiveness. These include strategic partnerships driven by a shared vision, long-term commitment to communities (10-15 years on average), integration with other sectors, and mobilising local religious leaders from across faiths as advocates for better WASH services and practices.","To reach our 2030 goals, World Vision will work with national governments, district governments, local authorities, and communities.

            Report with locations and volume estimations of deep groundwater aquifers",Somalia,"Norway, Somalia",Africa,"Somalia is currently experiencing the most severe drought of the last four decades. The eagerly awaited rains have failed to materialize, resulting in the drying up of boreholes and the failure of harvests. This dire situation has led to a hunger crisis with millions of people facing food insecurity at critical levels.

To tackle this urgent issue, the governments of Norway and Somalia, in collaboration with Ruden AS and other key players from the private sector, have pledged to leverage Norway's technological expertise in the oil sector to identify deep groundwater resources throughout Somalia.

To evaluate the feasibility of freshwater aquifers deeper than 300 meters, Ruden AS uses the unique approach to analyze data from previous Oil & Gas activities, combined with hydrogeology. This approach has been possible thanks to inter-ministerial collaboration. For the first time in history, a nation has made its complete oil & gas information database available solely for water exploration purposes.

The Ministry of Energy and Water Resources of Somalia leads the project and has the support of the Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources of Somalia. This cross-sectoral collaborative effort enables the project to be locally led and is instrumental in providing the project with access to crucial resources and information.

Together, we have committed to taking the first step that we hope will lead to saving thousands of lives in the near future.","Unlike shallow groundwater, deep aquifers are natural storage systems that protect water from pollution and contamination. More importantly, deep aquifers are less sensitive to immediate climate variations than shallow ones, as they derive their water from past precipitation - up to millions of years old. In some cases, deep aquifers can have continuous recharge from current rainfall occurring hundreds of kilometers away.

According to preliminary results, approximately 50 km3 of rain seeps into the ground every year in the highlands of East Africa and slowly travels through the subsurface of Somalia. Of this, around 10 to 15 km3 are potentially contributing to deep aquifers.

Finding additional sources of water in Somalia could be a game changer in easing or reducing the effects of current and future droughts. The project initially targets Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 6 and 2 related to water and food security, but ultimately aims to address SDGs 8, 9, 10, 11, and 13.

The ultimate goal of this initiative is to support Somalia's development not only by identifying drilling locations and guidance for future drilling, but also fostering knowledge and competence exchange on deep groundwater resources throughout the project's duration. This approach ensures that the country builds the capacity to rely on its own expertise. Through ongoing knowledge and competence sharing, the project aims to empower the local community and build capacity to address development challenges, ultimately contributing to Somalia's long-term prosperity.","Federal Government of Somalia: Ministry of Energy and Water Resources of Somalia; Ministry of Petroleum and Minerals Resources of Somalia; and Ministry of Livestock and Irrigation of Somalia

This basin has shown increasing degradation of water quality, with the occurrence of hypereutrophic areas (high increase in nutrient pollution - nitrogen and phosphorus) due to the lack of a systemic environmental sanitation strategy. Few municipalities in the basin have investments in urban sanitation, which is one of the major gaps in sanitation and degradation of water quality in the Itaipu Reservoir. Environmental sanitation is one of ITAIPU's actions towards water security, approved by the Binational Environmental Management Master Plan, and has strategic relevance for the company, as it acts in reducing the high nutrient loads in the rivers of the water contribution basin, avoiding the eutrophication of the Itaipu Reservoir and future problems of biological invasion by aquatic macrophytes, outcrops of microalgae with toxic potential, and exotic species that cause degradation of the dam concrete, and the clogging of refrigeration systems of the plant.

As part of our Brew a Better World sustainability ambition, HEINEKEN's water strategy focuses on delivering healthier watersheds and creating a water-positive impact in water-stressed areas with a focus on three key areas- water efficiency, water circularity and water balancing. Heineken's commitment to healthier watersheds looks beyond traditional water usage to prioritise the health of local watersheds, especially in water-stressed areas. Our first priority is to ensure that our operations are in order, for example, recording water efficiency improvement by 33% since 2008 and ensuring all our wastewater is treated before discharge. In water-stressed areas, we focus on efforts beyond our brewery walls at the watersheds through multiyear water balancing programmes ranging from infrastructure improvements to nature-based solutions. Collective action is a key priority as the watershed is a shared risk with other users.
Mechanism to identify sites located in water-stressed areas
We have a 3 step approach to water risk assessment:
Step 1: Our production units must complete a 'Water Security Self Assessment' as part of our company-wide risk assessment every year.
Step 2: We also conduct a Global Water Risk  Screening for all our operations at least once every five years or earlier in case of acquiring a new brewery or setting up a greenfield brewery. For this screening, we combine the Water Risk Aqueduct tool from WRI and work with geospatial services provider 52Impact, to conclude a first high-level assessment of breweries that are potentially located in water-stressed areas. 
Step 3: If a brewery is identified as 'potentially water-stressed', it must conduct a local, in-depth Source Vulnerability Assessment (SVA). This SVA aims to identify and assess potential risks that may jeopardise sufficient water quantity, quality and accessibility. These risks are evaluated from various angles, such as physical, environmental, social, political, economic, and regulatory perceptions. The report contains several sections which cover extreme events (drought, flood, earthquakes), present and future water conditions (physical, but also legislative) and expected effects of climate change.
If the outcome of the SVA confirms that a brewery is indeed located in a water-stressed area, then this brewery must become part of our water balancing programme under of 2030 water strategy 'Towards Healthy Watersheds'.
•           Part of the activities for a brewery in a water-stressed area is to develop a Source Water Protection Plan that safeguards water sources for the short, medium and long term.
•           The brewery in scope must also develop a roadmap covering all three elements of the 2030 Towards Healthy Watersheds ""Water Triangle"" consisting of 1. Water Balancing, 2. Water Circularity, and 3. Water Efficiency. The three parts of the Water Triangle should all reduce the pressure on local watersheds in a way that responds to the local context.","Clean water is a basic human need that should be accessible to all. There is sufficient fresh water on the planet to achieve this. Our ambitions and targets for our water strategy on Healthier Watersheds align with the benchmarks set by the UN Global Compact, and we are determined to contribute to the UN SDGs on water. Water quantity and quality are essential for brewing, also growing our crops. In addition, accessibility to water is critical to the most vulnerable communities where we operate. Therefore, our Water Policy and related strategy for 2030, Towards Healthy Watersheds, aligns with SDG6 and addresses company-wide and basin-level measures and standards, both inside the operations and beyond the fence, especially in those situated in water-stressed watersheds. 
There are eight targets within SDG6: clean and affordable drinking water for all; at which our efforts worldwide primarily contribute towards the following four targets: 
6.1 Safe and affordable drinking water - through the implementation of WASH and water balancing activities such as improving the reliability of drinking water networks as in Egypt with Beheira Water and Drainage Company and Ethiopia’s collaboration with World Vision, we want to be able to improve access to safe and affordable access to drinking water for people and communities. 
6.3 Improve water quality, wastewater treatment and safe reuse: to help achieve this and contribute to this goal, we have built three new wastewater plants in Haiti, Serbia and Nigeria, bringing us closer to our 2023 goal to treat 100% of our wastewater. For on-site circularity, we have built six water reclamation plants which treat and reuse wastewater for general cleaning to reduce reliance on fresh water. For off-site circularity, we are progressing while exploring ways to address local challenges such as limited infrastructure, perceptions and regulations. 
6.4 Increase water-use efficiency and ensure freshwater supplies: Our breweries in water-stressed areas have developed roadmaps that set out actions to support a healthy watershed by 2030. However, each watershed is unique, shaped by the ecosystem and biodiversity it supports and local governments and stakeholders, among other things.

The Water Academy will bring together leading academic institutions and business Executives from the five largest beverage companies worldwide to form a collaborative partnership focused on delivering innovative training and building human capacities on pressing water related issues at a large scale. Created as a multi-stakeholder collaboration between academic institutions, the “Water Academy”, seeks to innovate with industry partners to: 1.Promote knowledge transfer and capacity sharing 2. Offer a hybrid way of learning: virtual learning, on-demand learning, immersive learning (in a later stage) 3. Develop scientific based water solutions that inform water policies and programmes (taking learnings and best practices from the private sector) 4. Measure and monitor impact and promote replicability of water management practice 5. Facilitate conversations and partnerships to enhance our understanding of water issues 6. Advance SDG 6 - Support capacity building of sustainable management of water especially for Indigenous communities and marginalized/equity deserving groups. The “Water Academy” as an education platform for online, offline, and immersive learning has two-fold objectives: a) Forging skills and knowledge such that water management practices can be replicated and scalable b) Forging awareness and a water culture based on ethics and responsibility that come from a different attitude to how water is perceived and used.","The Water Academy aims to contribute to the global Water Action Agenda through the Agenda’s accelerator: “capacity building”, particularly to the global need for a “global network of education and capacity building on water”.

This is done in partnership with the Government of Ethiopia through the Ethiopia One WASH National Programme (OWNP). The OWNP is a multi-sectoral and multi-ministerial approach for implementation, monitoring, and policy development of the WASH sector. It is designed to centralise all coordination of public and donor activities. The UNICEF Ethiopia WASH programme’s four dimensions are: 1) sector coordination and knowledge management, 2) end open defecation, 3) rural WASH, and 4) urban and refugee WASH. The Danish funding supports the implementation of the general UNICEF WASH programme, and is expected to provide basic water services for more than 400,000 people, implement new climate resilient WASH schemes with the use of groundwater resources, and reduce the use of diesel by retrofitting water schemes into solar-driven schemes. The primary support is to Rural WASH (39% of funding) and Urban and Refugee WASH (20% of funding) as these reflect the Danish development priorities of access to water, climate resilience and gender equality. Within the Rural WASH support, the engagement focuses on five regions, namely Amhara, Oromia, SNNPR, Sidama and South West Ethiopia. Furthermore, the support will support the towns of Doyo Gena in SNNPR, and Ayssaita in Afar, under the Urban and Refugee WASH dimension. Denmark’s support has the following objective: By 2025, children and their families in rural, urban, and refugee areas have increased equitable access to safe, affordable, and sustainable water and sanitation services and appropriate hygiene practices at household, community, and institution levels. Adaptive management will be used to quality assure and prioritize the support to the programme, which is reflected in the amount of unallocated funds. There will be a mid-term review of the project, where an exit strategy will be proposed.","The programme is expected to provide access to basic water services for over 400,000 people in Ethiopia in rural, urban and refugee areas, thereby contributing to the implementation of Ethiopia’s One WASH National Programme and SDG 6. By supporting sector coordination and implementing through collaboration with the government One WASH National Programme, capacity building and a stronger water sector will be key impacts of the programme. The programme has also a large focus on climate friendly solutions. First groundwater mapping will be used to identify drought resistant resources, and ensure a more sustainable water supply. These climate adaptation methods will be supplemented by climate mitigation methods, such as electrified systems and solar driven water pumps, which will reduce the use of fossil fuel driven generators, for new and retrofitted water schemes. The WASH programme will positively affect children and youth’s health and reduce the risks for the most vulnerable children. It also reduces the burden of water collection, which effects many children, thereby enabling opportunities for education and growth. In rural and refugee settings, the programme will increase the number of water points in safe areas and private access to latrines, to reduce gender-based violence. Finally, the urban and refugee WASH component will improve water services for both refugees and host communities in Ayssaita, thereby enhancing their coexistence.",UNICEF,Goal 6,"6.1 , 6.2","Fri, 07/15/2022 - 12:00","Mon, 06/30/2025 - 12:00",https://www.unicef.org/ethiopia/water-sanitation-and-hygiene-wash,0.25,0.4444444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05494505494505515

To do so, it aims to leverage political and financial in-country support for the implementation of the actions in the coming years, to accelerate progress on the water-related SDGs, in line with the SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework.
In the process, Kenya has developed the IWRM Investment Package (IWRM-IP), which is designed to harmonize, integrate, and enhance implementation of priority IWRM conservation and development plans at national and catchment levels. Numerous governments, community, civil society, and private sector stakeholders are already working on sustainable management and wise use of water resources.
Despite such good efforts, there is shortage of funding. As a result, urgent conservation and development actions remain unfunded. The projects in the IWRM IP target these unmet funding needs. Intent is to leverage additional resources required to cover financial shortfalls.
The IWRM-IP has been designed to support conservation at the catchment level. The Investment Package is based on a common goal of “improved conservation and sustainable management of the catchment ecosystem for improved economic and social welfare,” aiming to promote application of “wise use” concepts; strengthen governance; build conservation awareness and capacity; encourage sustainable alternative livelihoods. The focus of the IWRM-IP is operational costs of carrying out essential catchment conservation and associated IWRM sustainable development activities in line with the National Water Resources Management Strategy.","The overall impact will be Inclusive and sustainable water security for Kenya
To realize this goal and aim, four Investment Packages have been developed that target the most pressing catchment conservation needs within the water catchments in Kenya, beginning with the Athi Catchment. These are:
# 1 Investment Package- catchment wise use and sustainable management. It will work to restore, rehabilitate and conserve catchment ecosystem services through incentives, collaborations and partnerships.
# 2 Investment Package- enhancing conservation awareness, capacity, and governance to build effective, inclusive, and sustainable systems for catchment management and use. Achievement of this is anticipated by building strong platforms for planning and action that foster cooperation among the different sectors, agencies, and stakeholder groups that manage, depend on, and impact the catchment ecosystem.
# 3 Investment Package- promoting sustainable livelihoods opportunities to strengthen local economic prospects and reduce pressure on catchment resources. Specifically, it would empower local communities to directly participate in and benefit from conservation by (1) providing alternatives to environmentally damaging sources of production and consumption, and (2) adding value to conservation-based markets and business opportunities.
# 4 Investment Package- strengthening conservation law enforcement and sustainable management. It will enhance application of laws and regulations through multi agency collaborations, so as to maintain conservation law and order in the catchment ecosystem services upon which so many people’s social and economic wellbeing and prosperity depend.","UNEP-DHI, UNDP-CAPNET, Ministry of Water, Sanitation and Irrigation (Kenya), Water Sector Trust Fund (WSTF), Kenya Private Sector Alliance","Goal 6, Goal 13, Goal 15","6.5, 6.6, 13.2, 15.1",,,https://www.gwp.org/en/GWP-Eastern-Africa/W E-ACT/current-projects/sdg-6-iwrm-support-programme-kenya-funding-match-making-initiative/,0.25,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05494505494505515

            Hosting of 1 to max. two more editions of the conference series until the end of 2026, ideally one in Latin America and one in Asia","Representatives of academia, governmental institutions, the private sector and civil society (e.g. participating NGOs)","Argentina, Ghana, Morocco, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia",Global,"The United Nations Office for Outer Space Affairs (UNOOSA) together with a host country and with the kind support of the Prince Sultan Bin Abdulaziz International Prize for Water (PSIPW) have been jointly organizing a conference series to promote the use of space technology in water management to the benefit of developing countries.
The Conference series focuses on applications of space technology for water. The initial event, on the use of space technology for water management, took place in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in April 2008, the second conference was organized in March 2011 in Buenos Aires, Argentina, the third conference in Rabat, Morocco in April 2014, the fourth in Islamabad, Pakistan in February-March 2018 and the fifth in Accra Ghana in May 2022. 
In 2024, UNOOSA and PSIPW will jointly organise the sixth International Conference on the Use of Space Technology for Water Management at a location to be determined.
Space technologies, including satellite remote sensing technology in particular, have demonstrated proven capabilities in meeting challenges of water resource management, as rapid population growth and development pressures continue to impose additional stresses on scarce resources. Continuous Earth observations from space are crucial to manage water resources for the benefit of humankind and the environment, as well as to provide important forecasting services to prevent water-related disasters such as floods and droughts.
Remote sensing satellites provide data on several key water-related variables (for example, rainfall, precipitations, floods, droughts, water storage, soil moisture and evaporation) using spatial and temporal scales that are appropriate for reliable assessment. A satellite-based approach to assessment and management of water resources is especially important in countries and regions of the world where adequate hydrological networks do not exist.
Starting with its session in 2004, the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) began to consider matters related to the use of space-related technology in water resource management. The Committee noted that in response to the deepening water crisis, space technology could contribute to a better water resource management by providing data and information on the availability of water resources and water use. The Committee also noted that once converted into practical information, scientific data on water resources provided by satellites could be used to formulate policy and implement programmes at the national, regional and international levels, including those of the World Bank, the United Nations Development Programme and other entities of the United Nations system.
The conference series addresses above mentioned issues, identify gaps, and discuss how space technology can contribute to better management of water resources in general, as well as specific issues such as mountain region-specific water challenges, combating desertification, water storage, floods and drought monitoring, ensuring access to safe drinking water and managing water-related emergencies in developing countries.","The purpose of the conferences is to increase the number of developing countries that have developed capacity to use space science and technology, as well as related applications, for water management and water-related scientific research. The conferences have a scientific and technical focus, involving experts from all world regions, but with a focus on regional needs and challenges while rotating locations between Asia, Africa and the Americas. The conference is conceived as addressing mainly public servants. Speakers consist of experts that will present how concrete technical actions have improved water management in their area of expertise, and experts that will debate in panel discussions about either technical or policy topics. Beside the main event, practical hands-on experience opportunities, like demonstration sessions or workshops, have taken place to complement the more theoretical and scientific presentations and panel discussions.","Host countries

The project comprises three pillars:
    -Foster scientific exchange via conferences, to inform decision making and have an impact on policy;
    -Reach and inform users worldwide, via the Space4Water Portal, to show-case excellent work and allow users to find partners based on their expertise or regional focus;
    -Community building via interactive Space4Water stakeholder meetings.
The portal brings together organizations active in the field to share information on projects, initiatives, satellite missions, software, community portals, capacity building & training material, conferences, workshops, data, as well as news and publications in the sector.
The international conference series on space technologies for water management serves as is described as a separate committment. 
The Space4Water Portal serves as:
    - a platform for interdisciplinary knowledge exchange on space technology and data (space-based solutions) for water-related topics;
    - an initiative to make information in the field discoverable and comparable;
    - a multi-stakeholder platform;
    - a platform to support capacity-building;
    - a portal for expert communities sharing information on software, applications, publications, projects and initiatives;
    - a portal which is inclusive for actors from developing countries.
Communtiy Building:
UNOOSA organises stakeholder meetings and events such as the Participatory workshop for indigenous women on their roles and responsibilities related to water to strengthen the community, to assess user needs and allow to address issues within the community of stakeholders. Methodologies used for community building are drawing on participatory design thinking methods. Design thinking is a human-centered approach to problem solving that offers methods for different stages of a problem solivng phase exploration, ideation, prototyping and evaluation.","As a platform for interdisciplinary knowledge exchange, the Space4Water Portal brings together experts from space technologies and water-related sectors to form a community of practice. On the portal, organisations and actors share information on projects/initiatives/satellite missions/community portals, software/webapps/tools, capacity building and training material, events such as conferences and workshops, as well as news and publications in the sector. This allows users to learn about successful applications of space technologies to address water management issues. Contact details of professionals and stakeholders, who also indicate thematic areas in which they seek to collaboration or knowledge exchange can be an incentive to initiate cooperation or even partnerships. 
The Space4Water Portal serves as a bridge between communities of both the water and the space sectors, but also between different types of stakeholders: academia, governmental institutions, inter-governmental organisations, private sector, private research institutes, non-for-profit organisations, and non-governmental organisations. Individuals representing civil society are interviewed and their views featured in the “Meet a Professional”, “Meet a Young Professional” and ""Indigenous Voices"" sections.
The monthly publication of articles or success stories as well as of an interview with a Space4Water actor serves the urgently needed science communication to raise awareness of the importance of addressing water issues as well as the potential of space-based technology to this end. This aspect of the portal makes very specific technical knowledge accessible to everyone by drawing on scientific findings but communicating it in everyday language.
A new feature allows to address submitted water-related challenges and incrementally build space-based solutions, drawing onto the knowledge and resources of existing Space4Water community members. Stakeholder meetings will serve as a platform to discuss and reframe challenges so they become solvable, and especially to kickstart co-designing solutions that address the water-challenges expressed.  Solutions are then shared on the portal so, third parties interested in the approach can reach out and learn more about addressing similar issues.

Beneficiaries from the rural communities, farmers, minorities, and youths, including female groups, who need support in learning new technologies, TVET support, and development of small sustainable farming facilities","Canada, Japan, Kazakhstan, United States of America",Asia and Pacific,"Kazakhstan harms the world community by increasing the water level in the ocean by annually releasing water to the Arctic Ocean in an amount of 16.5 cubic km of water per year from the North of Kazakhstan.  With increase of the ocean water level many islands, including islands of Kiribati, Seychelles, Maldives, Micronesia, Nauru, Marshalls, Solomons, Madeleines are under disappearing danger. It will be reasonable to decrease the amount of water, which is released from Kazakhstan to the Arctic ocean.
Kazakhstan is targeted to destroy the Caspian Lake, which is already a shrinking lake, similarly as the Aral Lake, by taking the Caspian Lake water for Hydrogen production in the West Kazakhstan, Mangistau region. Kazakhstan works on the implementation of the HYRASIA ONE project in cooperation with the European cleantech group SVEVIND Energy Group. This project’s aim is to build one of the world’s largest industrial plants for the production of pure green hydrogen in Kazakhstan with an investment of 50 Billion dollars. HYRASIA ONE is creating a wind-solar-hydrogen plant in Kazakhstan that will produce up to 2 million tonnes of green hydrogen or 11 million tonnes of green ammonia per year, https://hyrasia.energy/, https://hyrasia.energy/2022/10/27/important-milestone-achieved-investme…, https://invest.gov.kz/ru/media-center/press-releases/kazakhstan-obespec…
This Kazakhstan HYRASIA ONE project is identical to African Namibia  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75dXFyQ5m9Y, which is in development now. The complexity of Kazakhstan's HYRASIA ONE  project implementation  is related to the water resources availability issues and the cost of electricity in West Kazakhstan, Mangistau region.  It will be reasonable to develop the alternative solutions with reasonable expenses without harming Nature.
The alternative solution, which we are proposing to develop, is to set up the Hydrogen production facilities in North Kazakhstan, to use 16.5 cubic km of water, which is released annually to the Arctic Ocean. Moreover, North Kazakhstan has cheap electricity production facilities. Water and electricity will be low cost, to make the Hydrogen production reasonable. The Japanese Toshiba company already tested container-based Hydrogen production technologies  https://www.global.toshiba/ww/news/corporate/2015/04/pr2001.html  for more than seven years. A similar approach could be applied to the installation of Hydrogen and Ammonia production modules.  In this case, the electricity and water resources could be more connected and efficient for the next Hydrogen and Ammonia production chain.
Ammonia is a pungent gas that is widely used to make agricultural fertilizers. Green ammonia production, the process of making ammonia, is 100% renewable and carbon-free. Globally, the fertilizer industry is responsible for about 1.1% of annual carbon emissions, due to using fossil energy as feedstock (approximately 80% of production uses natural gas, while coal accounts for approximately 15%). Green ammonia is currently the fertilizer industry’s best bet at reducing emissions.","The New Global Framework for Managing Nature meeting, which was hosted in Canada, in December 2022, phased out reforms by scaling up positive incentives for biodiversity conservation and sustainable land use, with mobilization of at least $200 Billion/year from different sources for biodiversity-related funding, raising international financial flows from developed to developing countries to at least US$ 30 Billion/year, some of this support could be also applied for Hydrogen type of projects https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/cop15-ends-landmark-biodive…   Hydrogen production technologies could be connected and developed in cooperation with Toshiba company.
The Ammonia fertilizers production could be in cooperation with Kazphosphate  https://www.kpp.kz/. Kazphosphate represents Kazakhstan’s phosphorus industry, the leading company for the manufacture of phosphorus-containing products in the center of the Eurasian continent. Hydrogen and Ammonia fertilizers will be reasonable to deliver from the North Kazakhstan to the South, West and Central Kazakhstan regions, near the Aral Sea region, regions with water resources issues of Kazakhstan. In this case, Hydrogen transportation will be reasonable by its expenses, because it will be transported similarly to energy, oil gas, gasoline, diesel transportation to the gas stations now in Kazakhstan. Hydrogen will be in the category of energy resources, and will be respected by the local people as energy, not cheap water resources, as it is counted now in Kazakhstan by the local people. Water resources are counted as a cheap, mostly free, natural resource in Kazakhstan, that is why the water saving, water efficiency approaches are complicated to implement in Kazakhstan, https://www.mdpi.com/2073-4441/15/3/482 . The Hydrogen market introduction in Kazakhstan will update people’s attitude and be more efficient with water resources. The Hydrogen engine releases water as output, and this water will be in South, West and Central Kazakhstan regions, near the Aral Sea region, regions with water scarce issues of Kazakhstan. This approach will be more rational instead of construction of different canals, dams, and reservoirs, which are popular activities in Central Asian countries with high evaporation losses, up to 90 % in most Central Asian regions. The released water from the hydrogen engine will require enrichment with the proper amount of fertilizers, where Kazphosphate will need to cooperate with the drip, pivot irrigation technologies production companies. Drip, Pivot irrigation technologies from producers such as Valmont Valley, Zimerman, Reinke, TL irrigation corporations will benefit from the clean Hydrogen energy and high quality Ammonia fertilizers application for their  capillary spraying systems without clogging their narrow  pipe sprinkle irrigation systems. These connected chains in Hydrogen and Ammonia fertilizers production for Sustainable Agriculture to satisfy the New Global Framework for Managing Nature requirements require experts, technicians, who will work together on these activities. These efforts require the proper  TVET (technical and vocational education and training) capacity-building support to use these new sources of energy and fertilizers. The balanced use of natural resources and sustainable use of mineral fertilizers, combined with eco-friendly technologies, including sustainable water usage, a responsible attitude to nature, and biodiversity, require proper knowledge, and advanced irrigation technologies with scientific and TVET support.","Asel Tlenchieva, Chief Manager for Training and Development of Kazphosphate, Kazakhstan, WhatsApp: +77010282745,  tlenchieva.a@kpp.kz

The outputs are meant to be used to improve the menstrual health of adolescent girls and young women.",Global,Global,"Rationale:
1. A growing number of countries are developing policies and strategies on universal health coverage (UHC). Within this, WHO’s Department of Sexual and Reproductive Health and Research is working to ensure that the full range of sexual and reproductive health issues is addressed. This includes menstrual health.
2. There is growing interest and experience in addressing the menstrual health of adolescents, however this is still largely focused on informing and preparing adolescents for menarche, and for providing them with products.
3. In most countries, ministries of health are not really engaging in/contributing to menstrual health programmes. This means that case management of menstrual health problems in not really addressed.
Objectives:
1. To advocate with for the inclusion of menstrual health promotion, care, and support, and links to adequate water supply and sanitation, in the context of universal health coverage. While the initial focus will be on adolescents, this will extend overtime to the life course.
2. To work with partners to generate data and develop/update tools to promote menstrual health in the context of UHC and support countries in operationalizing it.
3. To support countries in using these tools to integrate menstrual health into UHC.
Proposed approaches: In relation to objective
1: WHO will work with UNFPA and the Global Menstrual Health Collective to advocate for this. In relation to objective
2: WHO will work with individuals and organizations involved in strengthening data on adolescent health, those involved in the case management of menstrual health problems and those involved in health systems strengthening work to synthesize available data, develop/update evidence-based case management tools, and set out approaches to integrate menstrual health into health and related systems. In relation to objective
3: WHO will work with UNFPA and headquarters, regional office and country office levels to use opportunities to support country level decision making on UHC to include menstrual health.","In relation to objective 1: (i) A shared understanding in the UHC community about the importance of including SRH and specifically menstrual health within this. (ii) Awareness of WHO’s programme support tools. In relation to objective 2: A set of programme support tools on integrating menstrual health in UHC. In relation to objective 3: Support to 10 countries to integrate menstrual health in health systems. Our vision is that women and girls and other people who menstruate, have access to information and education about it; to the menstrual products they need; water, sanitation, and disposal facilities; to competent and empathic care when needed; to live, study and work in an environment in which menstruation is seen as positive and healthy not something to be ashamed of; and to fully participate in work and social activities. Thirdly, to ensure that these activities are included in the relevant sectoral work plans and budgets, and their performance is measured.","UN agencies (UNFPA, UNICEF and UNESCO) Partnerships (Global Menstrual Health Collective) Academics (Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University)","Goal 3, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 17","3.7 , 3.8, 5.6, 5.c","Sat, 04/01/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2024 - 12:00","https://www.who.int/news/item/22-06-2022-who-statement-on-menstrual-health-and-rights

Menstrual Health was not on the agenda of the International Conference on the Population and Development or the Millennium Declaration. Nor it is explicitly stated in the Sustainable Development Goals. However, it has been placed on the global health, education, human rights, and gender equality/equity agendas by grass-roots workers and activists from the global South, drawing attention to reports of women’s and girls’ experiences of shame and embarrassment, and the barriers they face in managing their period because they do not have the means to do so, with consequences for their life opportunities including their rights to education, work, water and sanitation, non-discrimination and gender equality – and ultimately to health. WHO calls for menstrual Health to be recognized, framed and addressed as a health and human rights issue, not a hygiene issue: a health issue with physical, psychological, and social dimensions, and one that needs to be addressed in the perspective of a life course – from before menarche to after menopause.
Secondly, to recognize that menstrual health means that women and girls and other people who menstruate, have access to information and education about it; to the menstrual products they need; water, sanitation, and disposal facilities; to competent and empathic care when needed; to live, study and work in an environment in which menstruation is seen as positive and healthy not something to be ashamed of; and to fully participate in work and social activities.
Thirdly, to ensure that these activities are included in the relevant sectoral work plans and budgets, and their performance is measured. WHO recognizes that several sectors have equally important roles to play in promoting and safeguarding Menstrual Health and is committed to stepping up its efforts to encourage health policymakers and programme managers to engage with these sectors to promote the rights of women, girls and other people who menstruate and meet their comprehensive menstrual health needs, especially in humanitarian contexts. WHO is also committed to breaking the silence and stigma associated with menstruation and to make schools, health facilities and other workplaces (including WHO’s workplaces), menstruation responsive. Activists – including young people - and nongovernmental organizations have done much to place menstrual health on the agenda. A growing number of governments are taking action.
Finally, a handful of countries have put in place laws and policies for medical leave when one is experiencing pain, discomfort and other symptoms and signs related to menstruation. These are useful steps, but governments could and should do more than improve access to menstrual products. They should make schools, workplaces and public institutions supportive of managing menstruation with comfort and dignity. More importantly, they should normalize menstruation and break the silence around it. Finally, in the context of what is happening in Ethiopia, Ukraine, and elsewhere, governments should include an attention to menstruation as part of a broader Sexual and Reproductive Health response in those who are displaced because of war or natural calamities.",0.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6666666666666666,0.25,0.0,0.05494505494505515

            Project Implementation through Paludiculture","Children, Youth, Women and the Next Generation",Kenya,Africa,"Kenya wetlands extent is estimated to occupy around 3% to 4% or 14000 km2 of Kenya’s land mass although this can temporarily increase to 6% during the rainy season (Kenya Wetland Forum 2012). Millions of Kenyans including the local and indigenous communities living in rural and urban areas largely rely on wetlands for provision of freshwater for their daily socio-economic activities. Peatland ecosystem being one of the major wetland ecosystem in Kenya are vital for water security and must be protected for Kenya Water supply scientists warn. Kenya hosts approximately 88,840 hectares of peatlands according to Greifswald Mire Centre. In Kenya the pressures on peatlands freshwaters are immense, and degrade a shockingly large part of the peatlands water environment. Expanding populations and urban, agricultural and industrial development are adding yet more stresses. In many parts of the Kenya, damage from pollution, drainage, abstraction, infilling, culverting and channelization mean that clean natural freshwaters are essentially a thing of the past. For people this means dirty polluted water to avoid, not enjoy. This impacts on peatlands ecosystem have been accelerated with a general pre-conception that peatlands are an inconvenience to humans, that they are dirty, filled with insects, and therefore, should be drained.
Wetlands Conservation Organisation objective is to restore 50,000 hectares of peatland ecosystem and ensure the remaining undrained peatland ecosystem remain intact in Kenya by 2033. Materializing large scale conservation and restoration efforts to achieve this outcome depends on peatland assessments, technical and institutional capacities, as well as finance, policies and social acceptance.
Our initial focus will be on riparian communities around the Manguo swamp in kiambu Kenya along the Nairobi-Nakuru route. Manguo wetland near Limuru forms an important landmark. We will build a community-based restoration plan for the wetland. Our approach would engage disadvantaged groups such as women and youth as key stakeholders in order to facilitate the adoption of new solutions that will be incorporated into plans for this and other wetland restoration. We will recruit one thousand pastoralists, including women and youth. Publicity will be given to successful projects in our campaigns and stakeholder meetings in order to stimulate and replicate of wetland restoration programs in other regions of Kenya and even in other nations.  This project will help to enhance the lives of the people living in these areas, thus uplifting their standards of living through pure, dignified, and safe drinking water.","Wetlands Conservation Organization (WCO) is committed to provide all the necessary training necessary for the effective implementation of the project and will promote a model that encourages active participation from both men and women. The project will directly employ the people of the local communities at agreed wages, with higher emphasis on community projects that involve women, including but not limited to, university scholarships for girls from poor families. In addition, building and rehabilitation of infrastructure of the local communities will be undertaken, such as roads, organic home gardens, rain water harvesting tanks etc to ensure accessibility to the project area and improve their livelihoods. Life skills and vocational training will also be provided to the community along with raising awareness and increasing knowledge.
 SHORT TERM IMPACT
1.	Acquisition of knowledge and skills by 1,000 Manguo community about wetland restoration practices within the first year of the launch.
2.	Increased biodiversity in wetlands- 2 years from initiation.
3.	Improvement in the livelihoods to ensure that the values of local people are not overlooked in decision-making processes where international/larger organizations and commercial interests exert a disproportionate amount of influence. This can be remedied by organizing local communities into “wetland supporting groups” The key is to adopt an integrated, adaptable, and sustainable strategy that takes into account not only the current uses of a wetland, but also how these are likely to evolve over time. The scientific monitoring, design, and implementation of wetland restoration and management projects will be crucial. Working with both local and scientifically-based methods can determine the success or failure of restoration projects.
4.	Restoration of the wetland ecosystem services in the target area after 3 years of launch.
5.	Uplifting their standards of living through pure, dignified, and safe drinking water. 
 MEDIUM TERM IMPACT
1.	Acquisition of knowledge and skills by at least 100,000 Manguo Communities within 10 years.
2.	 Enhanced biodiversity on riparian wetlands.
3.	 Mitigation of degradation on at least 4 different wetland sites
4.	Enhancement of ecosystem services in four riparian ecological zones
5.	Uplifting their standards of living through pure, dignified, and safe drinking water. 
 LONG TERM IMPACT

The region has sufficient resources to meet demands for water, energy, food and environmental security but coordinated actions and cooperation between the countries is needed to address challenges related to sustainable use of resources due to population growth, economic development and climate change. Transboundary water cooperation is the key for sustaining peace, stability and prosperity in the region.
To advance transboundary water cooperation and peaceful water allocation the Central Asian countries work together under the umbrella of the Interstate Commission for Water Coordination (ICWC) in Central Asia. SIC ICWC as an executive body of the Commission fosters transboundary water cooperation and promotes sustainable water management in Central Asia through information collection and dissemination, knowledge production, capacity development, communication, research and expert advice.
Under the proposed initiative, SIC ICWC commits to work closely with the Central Asian countries and other partners to advance evidence-based transboundary water cooperation.
The proposed initiative has three specific objectives:
1.	DATA AND KNOWLEDGE: Establishing robust evidence and knowledge base on transboundary waters in Central Asia
2.	CAPACITY: Strengthening capacities of relevant actors in evidence-based water related decision-making and monitoring
3.	INFLUENCE & AWARENESS: Increasing research-policy interface in water related fields
To meet these objectives, SIC ICWC will:
1)	Produce new knowledge and research in support of regional policy dialogue on the sustainable use, management and protection of water resources in the context of climate change, including on resource use efficiency, improved water and land productivity, water-energy-food-ecosystem nexus, economic mechanisms, legal frameworks, social and cultural implications;
2)	Renovate databases, information systems and tools in support of monitoring and forecasting of water resources use and water security assessment;
3)	Strengthen capacities by providing tailored and needs-based trainings for different target groups, including on using data and evidence-based research outputs in decision making and planning processes;
4)	Build the community of experts and practitioners from different disciplines and fields, with a particular focus on young professionals and women.","The expected impact of the initiative is to promote inclusive and evidence-based decision making on water related issues in Central Asia with a view of enhanced implementation of related SDG.
The impact is expected to lead to:
•	Increased supply of data and knowledge to inform decision-making, planning and negotiations in support of regional water dialogues and sustainable water management;
•	Increased understanding of the benefits of regional cooperation and sustainable water management coming from evidence base research and data;
•	Enhanced standing and capacity of regional organisations such as the ICWC to act as an operative mechanism of transboundary cooperation;
•	Strengthen capacities of water professionals to understand the needs of other sectors and work in a multilateral environment;
•	Enhanced partnership among experts and professionals from multiple disciplines and sectors at different levels to work together on water security and sustainable development in the context of regional and global water challenges.",,"Goal 2, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 9, Goal 13, Goal 15, Goal 16, Goal 17","2.4 , 2.a, 5.5, 5.b, 6.4, 6.5, 7.a, 9.5, 9.a, 13.3, 13.b, 15.2, 16.6, 16.7, 17.14, 17.16, 17.19","Mon, 04/03/2023 - 12:00","Fri, 12/31/2027 - 12:00",http://cawater-info.net/expert-platform/index_e.htm,0.375,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.27472527472527575

UN-Habitat and UNICEF have also submitted the commitment as one of the High-impact Initiatives for consideration at the SDG Summit.
Thousands of water and sanitation operators provide services to billions of people but are often overlooked as a crucial actor in delivering the SDGs. They are well positioned to address the service gap for those left behind. The role of water and sanitation providers was underscored during the severe need for water brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic. Investing in this group of local actors is essential— both for day-to-day water needs, and to build resilience for future shocks. 
Former UN Secretary General Kofi Annan launched the Global Water Operators Partnership Alliance (GWOPA) in 2009, in response to the recognition that many of these essential water and sanitation operators (90% of which are public) need guidance and technical support, while others are highly capable and willing to support them on a not-for-profit basis. Over the past 15 years, GWOPA has assembled a wide network of partners and led a global movement to professionalize these peer support arrangements called Water Operator Partnerships (WOPs).  
The initiative pledges to accelerate the approach of GWOPA to engage at least 100 public water and sanitation service providers across the globe to sign up for a set of criteria of peer exchange and support. This Action is aligned with the UN SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework and is committed to addressing the capacity building of water and sanitation services provides through the scaled implementation of Water and Sanitation Operators Partnership practice, to develop a comprehensive open source infrastructure to provide data driven programming and capacity building and performance monitoring for utilities, to mobilize member states commitments towards establishment of a utility technical assistance facility to support infrastructure planning and financing to improve  access to financing, innovative solutions to help with  climate transitioning services and infrastructure, and to facilitate knowledge development, sharing and learning through community of practices, global and regional forums. 
The initiative will engage in multi stakeholders’ partnerships that assess challenges, builds, and embed knowledge, and design and implement solutions, drawing on a set of global normative tools. This will contribute to strengthening water governance and partnership ecosystem over time. 
The Action taps into the growing and broad-based GWOPA members and partners, building on the ongoing engagements by GWOPA utilities, governments, financial institutions, and municipalities, to support more public service providers to provide high quality mentorship to their peers. It expands on the investments already being made in Water Operators Partnerships to scale-up essential capacity development alongside billions of dollars of investments needed in local water and sanitation infrastructure.","Goal 6 of the Water Action Agenda, to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, underlies the attainment of every single other SDG, from ending poverty to eliminating hunger, gender equality, ensuring education, combatting climate change, ensuring life on land, providing renewable energy, supporting industry, and fostering peace and security.
Access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene is the most basic human right for health and well-being. Billions of people will lack access to these basic services in 2030 unless progress rapidly accelerates, including lagging behind on SDG 11.1 on access for all to adequate, safe and affordable housing and basic services and upgraded slums. Improved water and sanitation services furthermore help end poverty by reducing costs to the poor and improving livelihoods.
Strong utilities contribute to the achievement of all SDG 6 targets, while poor management and institutional capacity of these entities undermine progress. Water is pivotal to global progress, whether addressing inequalities, combatting climate change, or advancing peace and security. The role of local service providers as frontline actors is increasingly recognized in international processes and platforms such as the annual High-level Political Forum for Sustainable Development and the biennial World Urban Forum, which convene an array of partners to discuss global development imperatives and opportunities.
The Action is a low-cost global-scale movement to radically improve the ability of local service providers to play their full role in achieving the SDGs. Its innovation lies in the multiplier effect, and each new water operator partnership can easily be scaled at national levels.  With the backing of Member States, the Initiative is expected to strengthen 100 utilities between now and 2030, benefitting an estimated 100 million people with safer, more responsive, more resilient or more accessible basic services.  At the heart of its methodology and implementation strategy is solidarity between water operators globally to improve services, and ultimately access to water for the whole population, including the most vulnerable, in particular women and girls and under-served areas. 
Directly addressing SDG 5.5, gender mainstreaming in water and sanitation utilities and Water Operator Partnerships is an integral component of the methodology. Utilities can only improve their performance and achieve SDG6 and the Human Right to Water and Sanitation if they include the gender perspective, both in their service provision and their organizational structure providing opportunities for women equally to those of men still dominating the profession.
By focusing on capacity development and institutional anchoring, the benefits will be multiplied over time by leveraging of finance for investments, which often benefit of spin off from these partnerships.  There will be ripple effects, whereby benefiting utilities go on to support more peers through further partnerships. 
Beyond direct impacts, the peer-to-peer support mechanism will contribute to  practical understanding of solidarity-based partnerships in support of SDG 17 including North-South and South-South water operator partnerships.  It will raise the profile of water operators as a key actor in localizing the SDGs, raising the global recognition of  basic services providers in achieving the SDGs.",GWOPA Alliance Members (80+ as of March 2023),"Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 11, Goal 17","11.1 , 17.17, 17.9, 5.5, 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.a, 6.b","Sat, 04/01/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2030 - 12:00","Water Operators’ Partnerships (WOPs) are peer-support partnerships between water and sanitation service providers.

Critically, WOPs follow a Code of Conduct (French/Spanish) that sets out the principles for practice. (https://gwopa.org/wops/about-wops/)
Women in Water and Sanitation Utilities and WOPs
Women and girls carry the heaviest burden of responsibilities around water collection and caregiving. Access to these basic services directly affects the health, education, income and safety of women and other vulnerable communities. Moreover, less than one in five water workers are women, which GWOPA is working to address.  Women are also underrepresented in technical and managerial positions.

Monitoring of at least 1 case study in agricultural field in Italy and one in Tunisia, and development of forecasting models for at least 3 other Africal countries","The potential beneficiaries of high albedo solutions for water saving and climate change mitigation in Africa are numerous, and they include:
Farmers: High albedo solutions can help farmers to save water and increase crop yields, which can improve their livelihoods and food security.
Rural communities: Rural communities in Africa often rely on agriculture for their livelihoods, and high albedo solutions can help to mitigate the effects of climate change on agriculture, which can help to protect these communities from the negative impacts of climate change.
National economies: Agriculture is a major contributor to the economies of many African countries, and high albedo solutions can help to improve agricultural productivity, which can have a positive impact on the overall economy.
The environment: High albedo solutions can help to reduce water usage and energy consumption, which can have a positive impact on the environment and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Government agencies and non-governmental organizations: Governments and non-governmental organizations can benefit from the implementation of high albedo solutions by supporting the development and implementation of these solutions and promoting their use in agriculture.
Overall, the potential beneficiaries of high albedo solutions for water saving and climate change mitigation in Africa are numerous, and their implementation can have far-reaching impacts on the livelihoods of farmers, rural communities, national economies, and the environment.","Italy, Libya, Somalia, South Africa, Tunisia","Africa, Europe","Agriculture in Africa is the backbone of the continent's economy and plays a crucial role in the livelihoods of millions of people. However, climate change has posed a serious threat to agriculture in Africa, with increased temperatures and unpredictable rainfall patterns affecting crop yields and food security. To mitigate the effects of climate change on agriculture, high albedo solutions can be implemented to save water and reduce the impact of heat on crops.
High albedo refers to surfaces that reflect more sunlight and absorb less heat, which helps to cool down the environment. This can be achieved through the use of reflective materials, such as high albedo paints, coatings, and roofing materials. In agriculture, high albedo solutions can be used to reduce the amount of heat absorbed by the soil and crops, which can lead to water savings and increased yields.
One way to implement high albedo solutions in agriculture is through the use of high albedo mulches. Mulches are materials that are spread over the soil surface to protect the soil from erosion and moisture loss. High albedo mulches are made of reflective materials, such as white or silver plastic, which reflect more sunlight and reduce the amount of heat absorbed by the soil. This can help to save water by reducing evaporation rates and keeping the soil cool, which can also increase crop yields.
Another way to implement high albedo solutions in agriculture is through the use of high albedo paints on buildings and structures in farms. This can help to reduce the amount of heat absorbed by the buildings, which can help to keep the interior cooler and reduce the need for air conditioning. High albedo paints can also be used on irrigation canals and reservoirs to reduce water loss due to evaporation.
In addition to high albedo solutions, water-saving techniques can also be implemented to further enhance the benefits of high albedo solutions. Drip irrigation, for example, can be used to deliver water directly to the roots of plants, which can reduce water loss due to evaporation and runoff. Rainwater harvesting systems can also be used to collect rainwater during the rainy season, which can be stored and used for irrigation during the dry season.
Implementing high albedo solutions and water-saving techniques in agriculture can have numerous benefits for African farmers and communities. By reducing water loss and increasing crop yields, high albedo solutions can help to increase food security and reduce the impact of climate change on agriculture. 
In conclusion, high albedo solutions and water-saving techniques can be effective tools for mitigating the effects of climate change on agriculture in Africa. By reflecting more sunlight and reducing heat absorption, high albedo solutions can help to save water and increase crop yields, while water-saving techniques can further enhance these benefits. By implementing these solutions, African farmers and communities can adapt to the challenges of climate change and build a more sustainable future for agriculture in Africa.","The implementation of high albedo solutions in agriculture in Africa can have a significant impact on water saving and energy efficiency. The expected impact can be seen in two main areas: water savings and energy savings.
Water Savings:
High albedo solutions can significantly reduce the amount of water required for agricultural irrigation. By reducing the amount of heat absorbed by the soil and crops, high albedo solutions can reduce evaporation rates and keep the soil cool, which can result in water savings of up to 20-30%. This is especially important in areas of Africa that are already experiencing water scarcity due to climate change.
In addition, water-saving techniques such as drip irrigation can be used in conjunction with high albedo solutions to further reduce water usage. Drip irrigation delivers water directly to the roots of plants, reducing water loss due to evaporation and runoff. This can result in additional water savings of up to 30-60% compared to traditional irrigation methods.
Overall, the expected impact of high albedo solutions on water savings in agriculture in Africa can result in significant reductions in water usage, which can increase the sustainability of agriculture and improve food security for millions of people.
Energy Efficiency:
High albedo solutions can also have a significant impact on energy efficiency in agriculture. By reducing the amount of heat absorbed by buildings and structures on farms, high albedo solutions can reduce the need for air conditioning, which can result in energy savings of up to 20-30%. This is particularly important in areas of Africa that experience high temperatures, which can lead to increased energy consumption for cooling.
Furthermore, high albedo solutions can be used on irrigation canals and reservoirs to reduce water loss.

Host communities living around the camps also benefiting from Health and WASH services delivered to 2 refugee camps. In the DRC, beneficiaries of 120+ health facilities in Ituri, Upper Uele, Kasai Central and Lower Uele provinces. Total population of the intervention area is 1,000,000 people. In addition, it should be noted that MI undertakes similar WASH for health services interventions in other countries worldwide with a focus on Africa and Asia.","Democratic Republic of the Congo, Thailand","Africa, Asia and Pacific","Access to safe water, hygienic sanitation, adequate handwashing points, and waste disposal systems are crucial to ensure quality health care, which prevent the spread of diseases among patients, health care workers, and surrounding communities upholding human rights standards and dignity. According to the Joint Monitoring Program (JMP 2022) for water supply and sanitation, the state of WASH services in health care facilities is far from adequate. Only 78% of health care facilities have basic water supply, and about 51% have basic hygiene services. Moreover, only 21% of health care facilities in LDCs (Least Developed Countries) had a basic sanitation service. Particularly women and girls are disproportionally affected by inadequate, poor, and unsafe health care structures, and the negative impact of health and dignity on displaced persons and other vulnerable groups (elderly, persons with disabilities) is further exacerbated. Strengthened gender equality and empowering women and girls means that improved access to WASH must include a gender-sensitive and gender-transformative lens as it reduces maternal mortality and morbidity, decreases WASH-related illnesses during pregnancy stage for mother and child and prevents child death. With safe and gender-segregated WASH facilities, adolescent girls and women will manage their menstrual hygiene in dignity and safety. Inadequate and unsafe health care facilities pose a significant threat to public health, particularly in resource-limited settings like rural areas in DR Congo or refugee camp settings in Thailand, which are two settings highlighted in this commitment. MI has been providing WASH in health services to Myanmar refugees in two camps in Thailand and rural health services in the DRC since 1994. In Thailand, MI operates and run their own health facilities in Mae Ra Ma Luang and Mae La On refugee camps and covers all aspects of health care facilities. The health facilities have access to safe water supply, gender-segregated toilets, hygiene promotion and education including menstrual hygiene management, handwashing points with soap, and a medical waste disposal system. Additionally, in a soap production unit in Mae La Oon camp trained refugee community volunteers produce soap for health facilities in the camps as well vulnerable refugee households. In the DR Congo, health and WASH activities have been supported since 1994, and increased by convincing the main donors to integrate it better in their funding. In this context, more than 120 health facilities have been supported with infrastructure, equipment and WASH facilities since 2018. This included construction of water systems, gender segregated latrines and medical waste management facilities. In both locations WASH has become pivotal in advancing gender equality as women and girls are empowered to actively contribute to the provided WASH services, build their capacities and gain access to economic opportunities. The soap production in the camps in Thailand for instance is mainly run by women and girls. Malteser International’s current commitment is to continue WASH services in health facilities in Thai refugee camps until May 2026, whereas in the DRC such projects are in the pipeline until 2025, with further projects in the planning to be added in the future.","The main objectives of the WASH for Health facilities interventions in the DRC are the reduction of morbidity and mortality from communicable diseases in the population. This requires that in the health centers the WASH facilities are improved and ownership by the health center management is promoted to improve sustainability. Such activities are expanded with hygiene and sanitation promotion activities in the adjacent communities of the centers. The main expected impact of improving WASH infrastructure of health facilities in both the resource limited refugee camp settings in Thailand as well as in the rural context in the DRC is to reduce the risk of spreading diseases from hospital to patients, hospital staffs and surrounding households. The safe and clean sanitation facilities and hand washing points with soap put in place in the health facilities prevent spreading of diseases. Moreover, appropriate WASH services in health facilities improve the quality of health care services and is directly serving to achieve several health-related goals like those linked to maternal mortalities, and under 5, and neonatal mortalities. WASH in health care facilities is part of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) targets related to WASH. The SDG targets 6.1 and 6.2 are citing universal and equitable access water and sanitation for all. The term of “universal” can be applied to all settings covered by the health facilities in the refugee camps as well as rural context. Hence, this activity facilitates the acceleration of SDG 6. Moreover, SDG target 3.8 aims to achieve universal health care coverage including access to essential health care services, and target 3.1, aiming to reduce the maternal mortality. Therefore, improved WASH services in health facilities are supporting to reach the targets to SDG 3 as well. A recent impact study on “Integrated primary health care services in two protracted refugee camp settings at the Thai-Myanmar border 2000-2018: trends on mortality and incidence of infectious diseases” (Mohr et al.) was conducted in 2021. https://doi.org/10.1017/S1463423622000044 Major findings included that, despite the continuous drain of trained health care workers, the volatile influx of refugees, and the isolated location of the two camps, the initial basic curative health care developed into an integrated and comprehensive Primary Health Care project including a SPHERE-compliant water, sanitation and hygiene program. Malaria, LRTIs (Lower Respiratory Tract Infections), watery diarrhea, and dysentery morbidity dropped twelve, three, two, and fivefold respectively over the 18-year period evaluated while the health services utilization dropped from 7.1 to 2.9 consultations per refugee per year.

The issues related to world’s water and sanitation workforce are many and differ by region. While investments are often made in water and sanitation, commensurate funding for the required human resources to implement is not often taken into consideration. There is an inability to attract people, most notably women, to work in water and sanitation, often linked to social stigmas working in these areas, the conditions under which the work is performed and predominance of historically male-dominated professions. There is a lack of continuing education opportunities, educational systems are not aligned with the human resources needs, an insufficient number of workers willing to work in rural areas and a lack of financial resources for hiring and retaining personnel. Informal work is prevalent in low-income countries but not recognized, nor are there adequate programs to support formalization, improve employability and ensure decent working conditions. In higher income countries, the workforce is ageing, and large numbers are set to retire in the next decade without a sufficient influx of young professionals. Most countries are not even aware of what their water and sanitation workforce will require in the future and of those that do, very few have adequate human resources to carry out their plans. In all settings, women are underpaid and underrepresented in the formal workforce, particularly in leadership roles, while they are overrepresented in informal and unpaid work like water fetching and manual faecal sludge collection. In addition, there is often additional stigma associated with sanitation jobs, often rooted in historical discrimination. Overall, the enabling environment to attract, educate, train, protect and retain those working in water and sanitation is almost non-existent.
To address these issues, the above-mentioned organizations commit to the development of the World Water and Sanitation Workforce (WWSW) initiative, a global multi-stakeholder alliance of organizations from water/sanitation, agriculture, health, education, labor, economic development, technology, gender and youth that will work to attract, educate, train, protect and retain water and sanitation professionals to achieve and ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all, and ensure that there is a robust institutional framework in place to support this.
The WWSW will work on six impacts areas:

Assessment of the professional gap
	Enabling environment
	Attracting diverse talent to water and sanitation jobs, particularly women
	Education and training, including re- and up-skilling
	Ensuring employment security, health, safety and dignity in the workforce
	Retaining and strengthening leadership talent
The initiative looks forward to collaborating with the International Labour Organization (ILO), United Nations Educational, Cultural and Scientific Organization (UNESCO), World Meteorological Organization (WMO), United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), World Bank, Global Water Operators` Partnerships Alliance (GWOPA)/UN Habitat), Toilet Board Coalition and others to advance this initiative forward.","- Increased understanding of existing efforts on reducing the water and sanitation human resources gap - Increased understanding of the current workforce, gender disparities and working conditions, and of the human resources gaps that exist in water and sanitation at the national level - Increased understanding of the enabling environment for efforts to strengthen the water workforce and facilitate efforts in this regard - Local, regional and national governments, the private sector, and other stakeholders have resources and methods for professionalizing, strengthening and expanding the water and sanitation workforce - Improved working conditions and employability including occupational safety and health","African Water and Sanitation Association (AfWASA), Aquafed, Community of Women in Water (CWiW), IHE Delft Institute for Water Education, Indian Institute for Human Settlements (IIHS), Institute for Sustainable Futures, University of Technology Sydney, International Water Association (IWA), Pan African Sanitation Actors (PASA), Project Wet, SNV Netherlands Development Organisation, Sustainable Sanitation Alliance (SuSanA), WaterAid, Women for Water Partnership (WfWP) and World Youth Parliament for Water (WYPW)","Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 8, Goal 17","6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b","Tue, 03/21/2023 - 12:00",,,1.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.75,1.0,0.05494505494505515

SIWI will work with stakeholders at transnational, national, subnational, and local levels to implement cross-sectoral commitments, partner together for increased action on water and climate, and support implementation of the SDGs through holistic water-related solutions. We will advocate with others for strong commitments and collective action in support of the UN Water Action Decade 2018-2028, and for inclusive, holistic, and cross-sectoral water management to be placed at the heart of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the climate action agenda. SIWI is committed to empowering under-represented groups such as women, youth and Indigenous Peoples within water governance.
More specifically, SIWI will work with partners to support ongoing collective action by:
- Offering opportunities within World Water Week as an annual moment for participants to review, align and accelerate action on the commitments registered in the Water Action Agenda and to share solutions that can be upscaled;
- Continuing to develop and disseminate holistic water governance knowledge and good practices, and to foster learning across constituencies for increased impact;
- Supporting governance mechanisms for universal and sustainable water and sanitation services in countries where we work, directly, or with other partners;
- Offering, among other things, capacity development, development of new guidance/tools, support for new policies, national or local plans, coordination mechanisms, and for enhanced regulation and accountability measures;
- Creating space for all voices to be heard in different fora, such as advocating actively for gender equality, youth empowerment, Indigenous Peoples’ perspectives and values and a human rights-based approach that supports the most vulnerable or under-represented;
- Supporting and reinforcing countries’ capacities to develop and implement resilient water governance, management and services through ambitious and interconnected climate and water policies and strengthened NDCs and NAPs, in coherence with national development processes. Continue to drive action in cooperation with members of the Water for Climate Pavilion Collective;
- Championing the Source-to-Sea approach to address current and emerging governance and management challenges in a holistic, cross-sectoral manner, accounting for activities and impacts on land, freshwater, near shore, and in marine ecosystems, including in transboundary contexts. Continue to host the Action Platform for Source-to-Sea Management (S2S Platform) as a mechanism to build a community of peers, establish an evidence base, strengthen commitments and get source-to-sea action on the ground for an ever-growing community of diverse actors that collectively contribute to the Water Action Agenda;
- Promoting cooperation of shared waters as a catalyst for peace and conflict prevention by providing support to governments, basin organizations, and all relevant stakeholders, with tailored capacity development and dialogue support. SIWI is further committed to support inclusive transboundary processes with knowledge development, including research on water cooperation, water diplomacy, and water governance.  (See related commitments: Support of the Transboundary Water Cooperation Coalition; Adherence to the Finish expert opinion on the “Value of Water in Times of Armed Conflicts” issued September 2022).","Due to the transformative ambition of the SDGs, achieving its targets is inherently a collective action problem, one that needs to incentivize joint action by individuals and organizations in the pursuit of a common goal and where individual gain is dependent on collective gain through cooperation. This requires better organization and information sharing to build trust among the issue owners. This can be accomplished by providing a safe space where all concerned stakeholders can discuss diverse perspectives on how to advance towards a common outcome for which they feel equal ownership. Leadership is also key to driving processes that will encourage systems change.  
Following the initial collection of commitments, the Water Action Agenda will need to evolve towards this type of ongoing collective action exercise, which will: 
Inspire long-term transformation; 
Challenge assumptions to enable creative systems thinking; 
Deepen systemic and holistic understanding, including potential power dimensions and relationships that may need to be adjusted; 
Facilitate partnerships and expert networks; 
Encourage the convergence of similar initiatives; 
Create simplicity within complexity (break down action into smaller, more manageable parts and share responsibility); 
Be agile, yet robust, to accommodate adjustments from learning  
Value accountability, transparency and focus 
Both the Action Platform for Source to Sea Management and the Water for Climate Pavilion Collective have espoused these inclusive, multi-stakeholder approaches with demonstrated success in different arenas, such as the UN Ocean’s Conference or the UNFCCC Conference of the Parties. SIWI’s hope is to continue to grow these platforms that catalyze collective action in their domains, while offering the World Water Week as an additional annual platform for shared learning and collaborative planning processes. In this way, SIWI commits to addressing issues holistically, which will lead to more robust decisions, policies, and investments, effectively bridging silos and fostering cross-sectoral cooperation. 
The World Water Week can provide opportunities to check in on the operationalization of the Water Action Agenda by: 
showcasing commitments and reviewing their progress; 
highlighting ways to overcome obstacles to their realization; 
discussing how to upscale or replicate them; 
facilitating partnerships. 
In addition, SIWI is committed to providing specific support to countries and other parties to ensure good water governance and cooperation over shared water resources. Good water governance is essential to achieve water security, fairly allocate water resources for multiple purposes (health, energy, agriculture, nature...), and prevent disputes. It is a matter of determining who gets which water, when and how. It has social, economic, political, security, and environmental dimensions, all of which must be carefully considered, included and addressed, from scoping to decision-making. How societies choose to govern their water resources and services has a profound impact on people’s livelihoods and the sustainability of water resources, as well as on freshwater ecosystems. Ultimately, access to water and its sound management is a matter of survival and can, in many cases, help to break the circle of poverty. Improving water governance is, therefore, essential to alleviating global poverty and to the attainment of a broad range of SDGs, including, for example, health.","World Water Week Partners: Grundfos foundation, Government of the Netherlands, Meta, Arup, Republic of Slovenia, Nestle, Foundation for Food & Agriculture Research.

            Contribute to the body of knowledge around the longer-term health, education, economic, climate and environmental impacts of investments in sanitation, hygiene and MHH.","SHF targets the most vulnerable with the lowest ability to respond, and especially considers the potential for women's and girls' empowerment in rural and urban areas of selected least developed countries (LDCs) and thereby operationalizes the Leave-no-on-behind promise.",Global,"Africa, Asia and Pacific, West Asia","The Sanitation and Hygiene Fund (SHF) is a dedicated UN fund to bring transformative change to millions of people around the world without access to safely managed toilets, handwashing facilities and the means to manage their menstrual health safely. The overall goal of the SHF is to contribute specifically to achieving the Sustainable Development Goal 6.2. by 2030. Working globally and with an initial footprint in Africa, SHF is mobilizing resources to develop and fund a pipeline of investable propositions to create sustainable sanitation economies and menstrual hygiene marketplaces, driving national targets and helping women gain greater economic hold. SHF’s catalytic approach unlocks resources of multilateral and national development banks, finance institutions and governments, and enables the private sector to build lasting national sanitation, hygiene, and menstrual hygiene market ecosystems.
In line with the UN Common Agenda, SHF puts women and girls - their choice, voice and power - at the center of these markets so that they benefit from better health, education, jobs and a cleaner environment. SHF aspires to see thriving sanitation and hygiene economies and menstrual hygiene marketplaces where the poorest and most disadvantaged women and girls are able to take control of their bodies and their social and economic status.","The SHF bridges the development and finance worlds and will play a key role in assisting countries to navigate and benefit from innovative financing opportunities therein. Through its strategy (currently SHF Strategy 2022-2025), SHF pursues four main strategic areas where financing is urgently required.
1. Scaling-up off-grid, on-site household sanitation and hygiene services
2. Addressing menstrual health and hygiene gaps, promoting gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls;
3. Increasing sustainable water, sanitation, hygiene and MHH services in schools and health care facilities; and
4. Supporting all forms of innovation which work towards providing access to safely managed services for all.
Progress towards the global target of achieving access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and ending open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, by 2030 is lagging behind. This means that, more than 4 billion people globally are missing out on the education, gender, health, work and climate benefits that safe sanitation, hygiene and menstrual health bring, and 500 million menstruators are without the basics to manage their menstrual health and hygiene safely. 
Targets are missed because the available funding falls considerably short of the global need, and in many countries systems to support the sector are weak - lacking in regulation, reliable investment and capacity to deliver sustainable impact. Despite being basic economic, health, and social issues, they remain unaddressed. 
Similarly, funding for gender equality is not keeping pace with need, with only 4.6% of bilateral allocable ODA going to programmes where gender equality is the main objective. At the same time, it has been estimated that the potential global market for impact investing is as much as US$ 269 trillion (the financial assets held by institutions and households) and that the size of the impact investing market currently stands at US$ 1.2 trillion in assets under management. Channelling just a small proportion of this potential investment to social, environment and economic outcomes, would go a long way towards closing funding gaps.
Sanitation, with its potential for growth, is a sound, long-term investment that creates prosperity. For example, estimates of the sanitation and menstrual hygiene market potential are in Nigeria US$ 14.2 billion, in Kenya US$ 3.1 billion and for Uganda US$ 3.4 billion. In addition, in emerging markets small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) create 7 out of 10 formal economy jobs, and because sanitation and menstrual hygiene economies can be leaders in job creation, the scope for employment is significant.
In addition to progress towards SDG 6, investing in access to sanitation, hygiene and MHH drives impact across a broad range of development areas including SDG 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 13.","UN Sanitation and Hygiene Fund (SHF), priority country governments, local communities, the local private sector (other development partners and donors: the Government of the Netherlands technical partners such as SWA, the Toilet Board Coalition, WaterAid, IRC WASH, SuSanA; the Global Menstrual Hygiene Collective, SMEs; Innovative financing partners, f.e MDBs; DFIs; knowledge and innovation partners such as WHO, UN Women, UNFPA, UNICEF.","Goal 3, Goal 4, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 8","3.7 , 4.1, 5.1 , 6.2, 8.3","Wed, 03/01/2023 - 12:00","Thu, 12/31/2026 - 12:00","Countries : initially, Benin, Burkina Faso, Kenya, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Uganda.",0.125,0.5555555555555556,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05494505494505515

In partnership with civil society, public institutions and the private sector, Helvetas promotes technical and financial support services that improve living conditions and climate resilience in rural and urban areas.
Through our work in Water, we aim for public, civic and private actors to have enhanced competences to contribute to sustainable, equitable, accountable WASH and irrigation services, as well as to sustainable water resources management, benefitting especially disadvantaged women and men and ensuring that their voices are heard.","Increased access to safe WASH and irrigation services and a greater voice in water management leads to improved health, productivity and income, and increased water security for the underserved. Securing water management and sustainable WASH and irrigation services are responsibilities of national, subnational and local governments, with a substantial role of water users, be they local community organisations or private sector water users.
Project implementation supported by HELVETAS and its partners, strengthens the capacities of organised water users, providers of water supply, sanitation and irrigation services, as well as of key government agencies, so that water management and water services become more equitable, accountable and sustainable. Enhancing competences of involved stakeholders requires a good understanding of roles, competences, barriers and incentives, at different scales, from house tap and plot, to watershed, to sector policy and its implementation at national level. With explicit targeting, apt technologies, differentiated investment strategies, and detailed monitoring can the most marginalised be effectively reached.","Helvetas works in partnership with like-minded research, private sector and civil society partners enable to support change at scale.

Due to its transboundary and multisectoral nature, the sustainable management of water resources requires the creation of transboundary and multisectoral cooperation frameworks. Such policy, legal and institutional cooperation frameworks can help reduce conflicts and contribute to peace. Access to financial resources can be a strong incentive for such cooperation frameworks. But the current financial ecosystem rarely enables transboundary and multisectoral investments. The way financing currently approaches water and related investments is overly national and sectoral. Major providers of water-related services like basin organizations and local governments lack access to capital. Meanwhile, it is not only sovereign states but also local governments and basin organizations (e.g. River Basin Organizations) who are the main provider of water-related services and therefore accountable for their integrated and sustainable management. However, these entities are usually limited in their ability, including their access to financing, to successfully fulfil their mandate. Therefore, promoting access to public and private capital for these non-sovereign entities while strengthening their institutional capacities is crucial.
The Blue Peace Financing Program funded by SDC and implemented by UNCDF contributes to:  
- Unlocking public and private capital for better access to water-related services and transboundary water cooperation.
- Promoting access to public and private capital for water local and regional non-sovereign entities (e.g. River Basin Organizations), who manage water resources (surface and Groundwater).
- Providing Technical Assistance to strengthen the institutional capacity of these local and regional non-sovereign entities for them to mobilize and manage private and public capital.
- Providing technical support to these non-sovereign entities to develop pipeline of investment projects.
- Developing and implementing innovative blended finance mechanisms and financing instruments for water, peace and transboundary water cooperation.
- Transforming water cooperation frameworks into investment platforms through such innovative financing instruments and mechanisms.
- Creating enabling environments by transforming policy, legal and institutional frameworks.
- Developing measurement instruments and impact frameworks for financing water and transboundary water cooperation.
- Strengthening partnerships across sectors, including with the commercial financial sector (investment banks, stock exchanges, insurance companies, etc.).
- Providing a new impact investment opportunity for institutional investors.","This Program uses water as entry point to create and strengthen transboundary and multisectoral cooperation frameworks and transform them into investment platforms through innovative financing mechanisms and instruments. Given the fact that water is a cross-cutting issue relevant for all SDGs, this program will accelerate the implementation of all SDGs (directly or indirectly). More concretely, this program will create the following impacts:
- The current financial ecosystem will be transformed and better reflect the realities of our global challenges, including the global water crisis and climate change, which do not know national or sectoral boundaries.
- A new market in the sustainable finance field will be created, providing innovative investment opportunities for (impact) investors.
- The perception of the finance sector towards water and water-related projects will be transformed away from looking at water as a distinct sector towards recognizing water as a cross-cutting, transboundary (regional) and multisectoral impact investment opportunity.
- Local and regional non-sovereign entities managing water resources will have (better) access to public and private capital to fund and finance water-related projects.
- Local and regional non-sovereign entities managing water resources will have stronger institutional capacities and better legal and policy frameworks (a) to mobilize and manage funding and financing for water-related projects (b) for sustainable and integrated water resources management (IWRM) and (c) to build/develop and implement pipelines of investment projects.
- Countries who share water resources will have a strong financial incentive to create transboundary and multisectoral water cooperation frameworks and to manage their shared resources collectively and in a sustainable and integrated way.
- The water related investments promoted by the Blue Peace Financing Initiative will have a strong impact in the transboundary watersheds in crucial need of development initiatives. Hence, this initiative also offers investors the possibility to switch their investments from projects with a high carbon footprint to a blend of “green investment projects”. The biggest efforts that can be made to mitigate climate change are within the river basins targeted by the Blue Peace Financing Initiative. This reinforces the “Peace and cooperation” aspect of the initiative with an opportunity.
- Local Communities have better and more affordable access to water-related services, such as drinking water, WASH, agriculture, energy, etc.
- Inspiring new thinking on solutions in financing for transboundary water cooperation and peace and catalysing new ideas and initiatives.","UNCDF, International Municipal Investment Fund (IMIF), Gambia River Organization for Development (OMVG), Municipality of Freetown, Impact investors, private capital investors.",Goal 6,6.5,"Mon, 10/01/2018 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2030 - 12:00",Exact end date is still to be defined.,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.2197802197802206

The utilisation of the resources in transboundary aquifers is continuing and expanding. However, at the same time, the institutional effectiveness of the governance of transboundary aquifers is impaired by the institutional design around water resources, which is primarily focused on surface waters. As a result, groundwater resource governance regimes lack data, information, adequate management and governance at national and regional levels. There is therefore a need to create qualified technical capacity among all stakeholder groups worldwide in order develop and implement sound policies.
Through UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Hydrological Programme (IHP) the Governance of transboundary aquifers (GTA) programme has the overall objective to strengthen regional stability, cooperation and peace through the establishment of cooperative frameworks for transboundary groundwater governance in selected aquifers systems in Central Asia, the Middle East and West Africa (to exact regions and aquifer systems have yet to be confirmed).
Every regional intervention of GTA will be tailored to the respective regional context, thereby making use of the appropriate set of tools out of a pre-defined toolbox with four main lines of actions:
-	Awareness and capacity development: Raising awareness and inducing governance of groundwater among high level policy makers, whilst increasing capacity in groundwater re-source development and management at regional, national and subnational levels.
-	Policies, laws, institutions and governance: Effective governance relies on policies, laws, institutions and enforcement mechanisms. Developing/strengthening national/international groundwater policy frameworks and institutions is also expected to trigger increased investments in groundwater at international, regional and national level.
-	Sustainable groundwater management, monitoring and state-of-the art technologies: Groundwater needs to be monitored over time in terms of quantity and quality to identify possible negative changes such as over-abstraction, reduced recharge (including climate change effects) and pollution. This would lead to developing/strengthening groundwater management at local, national and regional levels, and fostering increased uptake of appropriate tools and technologies for resource assessment, development and management.
-	Knowledge sharing and coordination: Coordinating, harmonizing and sharing data represents the first step in cooperation between countries, allowing to move from diagnostics to actions and solutions, by increasing knowledge generation and sharing among member states and partners, whilst promoting cooperation between them.
In each region, UNESCO-IHP will work in close collaboration with key regional and national ac-tors having a mandate and legitimacy on groundwater, as well as actors having a specific thematic expertise. The programme is projected to start in 2023, with a first phase of 4 years, and has the perspective to last up to 2035.","The overall expected impact of this programme are protected and sustainable aquifers in selected regions. The protected aquifers deliver their natural services at the benefit of the society and the nature. Today and for the generations to come.
The expected outcomes of the programme are the following:
-	Groundwater resources in selected aquifer systems are protected and sustainably used and negative trends are reverted as a result of improved groundwater management and governance by strengthened river basin organizations and efficient state institutions responsible for water resources management.
-	Groundwater resources data is shared among the countries, laying the foundation of a transparent groundwater management process across national borders.
-	Capacities are built in international water law and hydro-diplomacy, with a focus on transboundary aquifers.
-	Dialogue between countries and stakeholders on groundwater resources takes place on a regular basis, also in search for financial solutions for sustainable management of transboundary groundwater resources.
-	Transnational agreements on groundwater management are achieved and implemented.
-	The awareness on the importance of groundwater to maintain and conserve dependent ecosystems is raised in order to improve the protection and conservation of freshwater biodiversity in the river basins

Together with the 1997 UN Watercourses Convention, the UNECE Water Convention consolidates the principles of current international water law. Complementing existing regional river basin agreements, the UNECE Water Convention aims to encourage the Parties to these agreements to undertake the necessary legal changes and fill the regulatory gaps where no regional agreements yet exist. The overall objective of the Water Convention's work programme is to promote the joint management of transboundary waters by riparian states worldwide in order to foster sustainable development, peace and security.
With its financial contribution, Switzerland supports the implementation of the Programme of Work of the Water Convention (ECE/MP.WAT/63/Add.1) and its 5 objectives: 1) Countries understand the Convention, accede to it, develop agreements and establish joint bodies for transboundary water cooperation, 2) Transboundary water resources in transboundary basins are monitored and assessed, and information is shared among riparian countries; 3) Integrated water resources management is implemented at all levels in a changing climate; 4) Transboundary water cooperation and basin development are sustainably financed; and 5) Transboundary water cooperation is monitored and partners are mobilized to support it.
A special focus of the Swiss contribution lies on activities in the following programme areas: 1) Increasing awareness of and accession to the Convention and application of its principles drawing on the benefits of cooperation; 2) Supporting monitoring, assessment and information-sharing in transboundary basins; 3) Promoting an integrated and intersectoral approach to water management at all levels; 5) Facilitating funding and financing of transboundary water cooperation and basin development; 7) Partnerships, communication and knowledge management.
With its contribution, Switzerland pursues to:
- Support the global opening of the convention by: building capacity on the Water Convention in countries which are not yet Parties to the Convention; supporting national accession processes; increasing understanding and awareness on the Convention and laying the basis for the creation of a “common home” for transboundary water cooperation issues in the UN system.
- Promote transboundary water cooperation through the application of policy and technical tools developed under the Convention, in particular on the benefits of cooperation, monitoring and assessment, the water-food-energy-ecosystems nexus and financing transboundary cooperation and climate adaptation. While supporting action in specific countries, transboundary basins and regions, the contribution will promote the scaling up of results through the promotion of exchange of experiences and good practices.","Through the promotion of the water courses convention UNECE seeks to support governments of riparian states of an international water system - river, lakes, and  aquifers-  to cooperate in way that allows for  the sustainable, peaceful and equitable management and use of limited water resources.
The overarching goal of UNECE’s programme on the water convention is to maintain and secure the availability of freshwater in all riparian countries sharing water resources, for the entire population of today, but also for generations to come. Moreover, the goal is to achieve balanced and equitable allocation decision procedures between the riparian states (upstream, downstream), the different sectors (such as water for people, agriculture, energy, industry, etc.), but also between the different social groups of the population (rich and poor) as well as towards nature (human needs versus the needs of ecosystems).

Finland collaborates with state and non-state actors in developing activities related to water diplomacy. These activities include conflict analyses and mediation, joint initiatives, and capacity building, all of which strengthen conflict prevention. Finland pays special attention to measures that enhance the role of women and youth in peace processes.
Water Cooperation and Peace – Finnish Water Way is a joint ministerial project that supports the implementation of Finland’s goal of sustaining peace and contributing to security by making water visible in its peace initiatives as well as its foreign and security policy, and by strengthening water cooperation.
The aim of the project is to support and implement proactive foreign and security policy and active mediation to prevent and resolve water-related conflicts. This will be achieved by strengthening the links between Finland's two international strengths: mediation and water expertise.
The joint project focuses on strengthening the capacity of Finnish water diplomacy actors to respond to growing needs at different levels, as part of mediation, international water diplomacy cooperation and multilateral global cooperation.
The project seeks to
* strengthen Finnish water diplomacy collaboration internationally,
* reinforce international transboundary agreements and their implementation by supporting the active participation and experience sharing of Finnish experts,
* identify and respond to Finnish and international water diplomacy training and competence-building needs,
* build the capacity of Finnish water diplomacy actors, and
* deepen cooperation between experts in foreign and security policy, peace mediation, and the water sector.
The project is implemented in cooperation with the Finnish Water Diplomacy Network that consists of experts from ministries, academia and research institutions, non-governmental organisations, and the private sector.","The project will strengthen the linkages between Finland's two international strengths, mediation, and water management, through a cross-governmental and cross-sectoral approach.

The aim is for joint institutions and legal frameworks which unite countries to resolve disputes peacefully. Sharing water lays the foundation for human development and security and enables more successful socio-economic development. The initiative contributes to increasing water, food and energy security and safeguarding ecosystem services in an increasingly aggravated context of advancing climate change. Blue Peace endeavours to transform destructive competition over limited resources of fresh water into constructive collaboration.
The Blue Peace initiative involves currently the following 9 regional and international development programmes: Blue Peace Central Asia, Blue Peace Middle East, Blue Peace West Afrika (Blue Peace Financing), support to the UNECE Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention), the IUCN Building River Dialogue and Governance (BRIDGES), the UNESCO Governance of Transboundary Aquifers (GTA), the Mekong River Commission and the Geneva Water Hub. Alongside with Switzerland’s efforts in hydro-diplomacy, these complementary projects and programs provide technical assistance and engage with a long-term perspective in improved integrated water resources management across boundaries and sectors at basin level (SDG6.5 in combination with entire SDG6 and positive impacts on other SDGs) in different regions of the world. The conceptual foundation of the Blue Peace initiative is laid in the report of the Global High-Level Panel on Water and Peace “A Matter of Survival”.   
In practice, Blue Peace enables different stakeholders around a water resource to come together to make equitable decisions about and invest in shared water resources to promote peace, as a basis for sustainable development and vice-versa.
The Blue Peace initiative promotes cooperation at bilateral, regional and multilateral level that can be formal or informal, in the form of shared institutions such as joint training centres and legal frameworks such as transboundary water agreements. As water quantity and quality questions are fundamental both in national policy making and at all levels of international water cooperation, the Blue Peace initiative strengthens and promotes mechanisms of water data collection, storage and access as the foundation of transparent, knowledge-based and data-driven decision making. It further promotes water capacity building and training at different levels (for local citizens, technical and academic levels) with the objective to raise awareness, enable transparent and meaningful citizens participation and to build the necessary qualifications required for decision-making processes and managing water resources across borders. The Blue Peace initiative further promotes collaborative transboundary projects with the development of joint and bankable investment plans at basin level across national boundaries. It also seeks to create new and innovative investment vehicles to incentivize investments in transboundary water cooperation. Finally, the Blue Peace Initiative promotes and enables “safe spaces” and high-level mechanisms to discuss and coordinate transboundary water issues. It helps to build trust as the key precondition for any cooperation.","The Blue Peace initiative and its international development projects seek to support governments and local communities of riparian states of an international water body - river, lakes, and aquifers-  to cooperate in a way that allows for the sustainable, peaceful and equitable management and use of limited water resources.
The overarching goal is to maintain and secure the availability of freshwater for all riparian countries sharing water resources – not only for the population of today, but also for generations to come. Moreover, the goal is to achieve balanced and equitable allocation decision procedures between the riparian states (upstream, downstream), the different sectors (such as water for people, agriculture, energy, industry, etc.), but also between the different social groups of the population (rich and poor) as well as towards nature (human needs versus the needs of ecosystems). Ultimately, this initiative should contribute to the peace, stability, prosperity and sustainability of the riparian states, their citizens and their development, all of which depend on the shared and limited freshwater resource.","Partner countries’ governments, UNCDF, UNESCO, UNECE, IUCN, Regional Environmental Centre for Central Asia (CAREC), International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS), Water Diplomacy Center of the Jordan University of Science and Technology, Inter-Islamic Network on Water Resources Development and Management (INWRDM), l'Organisation pour la mise en Valeur du Fleuve Gambie (OMVG), l'Organisation pour la mise en valeur du fleuve Sénégal (OMVS), Mekong River Commission","Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 10, Goal 11, Goal 13, Goal 15, Goal 16, Goal 17",6.5,"Sat, 01/01/2011 - 12:00","Thu, 12/31/2026 - 12:00","Regions : Global, with special focus in Central Asia, Middle East, West Africa, South East Asia

This innovative private equity fund is focused on financing sustainable and scalable solutions that improve access to clean and affordable drinking water for bottom of pyramid populations in Sub-Saharan Africa and South and Southeast Asia. The Fund is designed to address the significant funding gap that currently exists in the water sector. Specifically, the fund targets impact-first private equity and quasi-equity investments in the water sector, with a focus on investing in safe water enterprises, scaling piped infrastructure, treatment technologies, and other types of companies in the water access value chain.","The drinking water supply industry has traditionally relied on public financing, which falls short of the estimated $114 billion per year needed to attain SDG 6. Moreover, only $13 billion in ODA is currently available. W2AF aims to bridge this gap by mobilizing patient capital for private entities that have demonstrated their ability to enhance water accessibility. By scaling access to affordable safe drinking water to the underserved by  investing in innovative water businesses, the Fund aims to provide 20 billion liters of safe drinking water by 2030 to 30 million people (SDG 6), which comes from the acknowledgement that 3 out of 10 people do not have access to safe drinking water in emerging countries. This will be done with a climate lens in order to improve people’s resilience to climate change and support the protection of the environment (SDGs 7, 12 and 13), as well as with a gender lens, with the idea that women will disproportionately benefit from the services because they will save time (since women and girls are responsible for water collection in 80% of households, which affects their school attendance or they ability to do productive work due to lack of time) (SDG 5).","1.1.

The program is in-line with the National Development Strategy 2016-2035 and the National Water Resources and Sanitation Policy 2018. The program is one of the outcome of the Solomon Islands Water Sector Adaptation pilot project jointly implemented by UNDP and MMERE-WRD in 2015-2019/20 where water supply source diversification was seen as one intervention in the water supply systems against negative impact of CC on the water resources sector. The initiative/program is a partnership between individuals, private, public, organizations, companies and institutions who require alternative water supply sources as the conventional sources if un reliable. The services provided by the government for groundwater assessment, drilling and development of boreholes was paid for by those requesting the services. Once completed the ownership rest on the borehole owner. The government is responsible for rehabilitation of the boreholes for a period of 1-2 years depending on the type of rehabilitation.

Sendas' vision is to promote sustainability through the management of natural resources, rural development with justice and the search for new environmental rationality that allows a good life for people in the countryside and the cities. At central Veracruz, México, close to Xalapa City, we are currently experiencing a series of problems related to the absence of territorial planning that puts the WATER in the first place for public policies and rural and urban development. Forests deteriorate due to urban and industrial expansion, as well as scale-up crops with high use of agrochemicals, jeopardising the balance in the region. For 16 years, SENDAS, a non-profit NGO, has promoted territorial management with a watershed approach. The work proposals emerge from a socio-environmental assessment of the reality of the watershed, networking processes that enclose citizen initiatives in which WATER has relevance above other interests. That is why we work at: *Environmental compensation policies *Productive alternatives to maintain the health of the forest, water and soils *Community water committees to strengthen distribution and supply networks. *Rain Harvest Pilot Programs We have a 5 year strategic planning to valuate the strategies and re-focused them We ask the international community and representatives of the Mexican government for the recognition of community-based water management.

            The final result of the implementation of the commitment will be the global adoption of a universal model for creating ""Local Water Strategies"" implemented by ""Local Water Partnerships"", which will contribute to achieving the indicators assumed in the SDG","Direct beneficiaries of the initiative are:
1. Local communities conducting their activities within the micro/small catchment area, including:
- household,
- farmers,
- forest owners,
- entrepreneurs,
- local non-governmental organizations,
- local educational institutions.
2. Local governments and public institutions responsible for:
- management of water resources,
- crisis management,
- implementing local strategies of socio-economic development.
3. Regional governments and institutions,
4. National authorities and institutions responsible for water management, environmental protection, agriculture, internal security, economy, socio-economic development, labour market.
5. International institutions and organizations responsible for ""water security: in the global dimension, e.g. UN, EU, international non-governmental organizations.
The initiative can directly have a beneficial effect on:
1. Micro/small water resources, catchments, river basins, seas and oceans, including surface and underground waters,
2. Natural resources, including forests, wetlands, steppes, drainage basins, mountains, deserts and other biocenoses
3. Economy and labour market in local and global dimension.","Italy, Norway, Poland, Sweden",Europe,"The aim of new theoretical initiative (proposal for future actions under the Water Action Agenda) is to present of the universal model (possible to implementation in any conditions, globally, according to one methodology) 'local water partnerships' as the basic organisational unit (public-private-nongovernmental partnerships) which will be planning and implementing 'local water strategies"" at the local (micro / small catchment) level.
Model assumptions:
1. Universal approach,
2. Involving local stakeholders to realise the local and global goals.
3. Adopting LEADER method (proven in the EU),
4. Correlation of the model to crisis management systems of the states, in the context of threats related to floods, drought, ecological and other disasters
5. Changing the approach to planning water resources management from top-down to bottom-up planning.
The study assumes that a 'Local Water Partnership' will be an organisational form of grouping/association/union of public, social, private partners to implement a Local Water Strategy' in relation to the stated SDG, including:
1)	Development and implementation of a local water strategy based on a functional area such as a micro / small catchment, taking into account hydrological, climatic, geological, urban, technical, agricultural, forestry, social, cultural and other relevant conditions.
2)	Development and implementation of:
- local water security plan,
- local plan for the supply of water to agriculture and industry.
3) Obtaining the synergy effect in the use of private, public and social funds in the implementation of investment tasks especially local critical infrastructure,
4) Coordination of:
- construction activities related to: drinking water supply, sewage treatment, water retention, flood control measures, protection of natural resources and others.,
- surface waters protection and quality enhancement,.
- groundwater protection,
5)	Ordering of expert tasks (studies, plans, maps, feasibility studies, projects).
6)	Implementation of training and education activities, and cooperation/participation in the water security system.
7) Undertaking cooperation at the local, regional, national and global level.
Each entity (legal entity and individual) which will operating within a 'Water Partnership' will have the opportunity to act independently, according to its domain and vocation (assigned social, public, economic function). The assumption is that this will result in the partnership - as the sum of the actions of many diverse actors - acquiring properties that none of its constituent parts have.
The basic features of the initiative consist in:
−	Bottom-up initiatives (broad community participation in strategy development and implementation, social participation, social responsibility),
−	Territoriality of initiatives (local water strategy prepared for a defined, geographically coherent area / micro / small catchment),
−	Integration (linking of different economic fields, and cooperation of different interest groups, taking into account the interests of the excluded and the weakest groups),
−	Partnership (local partnership involving various actors from the public, social and economic sectors),
−	Innovation (implementing available innovations, creating new local, adjusted to specific conditions innovations),
−	Decentralisation of management and funding with social participation democratic governance, transparency of procedures,
−	Networking and cooperation (exchange of experience and dissemination of good practices, achieving regional and global goals at the local level).","Implementation of a new universal model for comprehensive management of water resources at the local and social level will significantly accelerate the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals
The creation of legal and organizational (based on scientific research and practical experience) conditions for the creation of ""local water partnerships"" based on civil society, private entities, local governments and institutions will enable the integration of the local community to comprehensively solve problems related to ""water security"". In principle, a public-private-non-governmental partnership wiil be able to achieve a synergy effect in achieving local (social, economic, environmental, political) goals, taking into account SDG.
The basis for the operation of local partners is the ""Local Water Strategy"", developed for the area of a micro / small catchment area, taking into account climatic, environmental, geological, hydrological, economic, social, cultural conditions and refers to ""water security"".
The ""Local Water Strategy"" includes a comprehensive approach to determining local water resources, risks (drought, flood, disasters), needs of the population, agriculture, industry, shortages, pollution of surface and underground waters.
The strategy defines responsibility for the implementation of specific priorities, goals, investment tasks, training and educational needs, control, supervision with equal access for all local partners, with democratic principles in partnership management.
The strategy is developed on the basis of local needs and priorities with reference to regional, national and global objectives.
The strategy assumes cooperation (networking) with neighbouring local water partnerships, being part of the regional, national and global water strategy in terms of watersheds, including micro / small catchment, river basin, catchment of seas and oceans.
Local Water Partnerships implementing Local Water Strategies will contribute to:
1. Determination of local water resources, risks, principles of management, protection, retention, and ultimately system of water supply for agricultural production. This will eliminate hunger, achieve food security and better nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture at the local level through social commitment to water management.
2. Ensuring the availability and sustainable, rational, economical management of water and sanitation for all partners / beneficiaries of local water strategies responsible for ""their"" resources.
3. Sustainable economic growth in the local dimension, based on local human resources, local innovations, strengthening the local labor market.
4. Construction of local infrastructure related to water management, in particular local critical infrastructure contributing to raising the level of ""water security"".
5. Strengthening local crisis management systems through involvement and cooperation in counteracting crisis threats (droughts, floods, natural disasters)
6. Integration of activities in the field of water resources management both in urban, rural, forest and other areas within watersheds.
7. Achieving economies of scale, especially in terms of limiting the dynamics of climate change.
8. Possibilities of controllable crisis management at the regional / national / global level thanks to the networking of local partnerships, including the activation of ""water"" local critical infrastructure of small catchments  (as an element of crisis management system) to reduce threats in the area of other catchments (e.g. flood prevention, water retention prevention of drought, prevention of the spread of contamination and water pollution).","The initiative (at the moment, the model is theoretical and is ready for implementation in the future) developed by dr. Slawomir Gromadzki (representative of Alina Gromadzka Farm) to Water Action Agenda is the result of many years of cooperation with various partners at the local, regional, national and international level and was based on:
- practical experience in managing Alina Gromadzka Farm, an organic dairy farm which is a shareholder of MLEKPOL Dairy Cooperative in Grajewo, Poland 2007-2023,
- research experience (assistant professor, head of the Department of Internal Security) Ignacy Moscicki's University of Applied Sciences in Ciechanow, Poland, 2015-2023,
- rich local government experience (deputy mayor of the Maly Plock commune and councilor of the regional council of the Podlaskie Voivodship), 2004-2010,
- past experience in managing the Local Action Group """"he Land Flowing with Milk""  in Maly Plock (partnership of 8 communes), 2006-2010,
- past experience in managing the Podlaskie Voivodeship Agricultural Advisory Centre, 2002 - 2008,

            Recommendations for UN Pollution targeted Conventions to include appropriate restoration defintions",Water4All community,"Nigeria, United States of America",Global,"The objectives of the “Water Restoration” Commitment are to:
•	Promote the adoption of standards-based ecological restoration for inland and coastal waters in order to improve ecological, social, and ecosystem services outcomes from restoration investments
•	Increase awareness and recognition of the importance of inland and coastal waters restoration to achieve the objectives of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration
•	Create a common legal definition of ecological restoration in the context of inland and coastal waters in order to create consistency in delivery of local, national, and global restoration programs
•	Strengthen understanding of the Restorative Continuum as a tool for improving delivery of ecosystem and ecological restoration in inland and coastal waters
•	Stimulate global and political momentum for the revision and update of water and pollution conventions in line with restorative continuum
•	Strengthen the links between policy, research and practice to enable effective restoration of in-land waters
•	Raise awareness among law practitioners, regulators, and decision makers of the value of standards-based restoration to reduce both risk and uncertainty, and therefore to improve restoration outcomes. 
Its target audiences include:
•	Practitioners and researchers from across all sectors (e.g. governmental, nongovernmental, industry, regulatory) who work in the field of nature restoration of inland waters, including all freshwater ecosystems, wetlands, estuaries, etc.
•	Professionals responsible for applying environmental laws and regulations (lawyers, judges and prosecutors) at the global, regional, and national levels.
•	Practitioners responsible for complying with environmental laws at the national, local, and basin levels
•	Political and economic decision-makers at global level.
The Commitment promotes the adoption and use of standards-based ecological restoration of inland and coastal aquatic systems in order to achieve the objectives of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration, and to deliver ecological and social net gain by restoring these systems. Signatories will commit to carry out individual and joint actions to promote, assess and demonstrate restoration standards in different societal dimensions, in line with the SDGs 6 and 15.
SER together with University of Évora will coordinate governance and follow-up regarding the commitments made.","Expected Impact
The IPBEs global assessment emphasized the need for transformative change if Nature Contributions to People (NCP) are to be secured and the importance of mainstreaming of biodiversity into sectoral policies. The UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration also calls for transformative change by 2030. In recent decades, ecological restoration has emerged as a key solution to halt degradation and accelerate the recovery of ecosystems’ physical, chemical, and biological integrity to ensure their functionality over time. Research plays a pivotal role in promoting transformative change in society including creating science-based legal frameworks that can help secure Natures Contributions to People.
Inland and coastal water ecosystem restoration is high on the international agenda due to their continued degradation and their important role in provisioning freshwater for human consumption (United Nations, 2016; IPBES, 2018a). A myriad of International conventions and treaties mention restoration practices at global scale and the need for cooperation between States to effectively achieve Sustainable Development Goals. (Target 6.6 of SDG 6 and SDG 15).
Although multiple international, regional and national legal instruments have included references to restoration in their texts (e.g. UN Water Convention), these instruments rarely define or provide any guidance on what type of restoration (e.g. ecosystem vs ecological), how restoration relates to other conservation practices, and how it should be implemented. This creates significant confusion in the use of similar terms (rehabilitation, mitigation, remediation, recovery) in legal instruments, as well as an extended fragmentation of environmental law that may hinder the achievement of restoration goals. Therefore, there is a need for a new legal principle or protocol on ecological restoration.
At the regional level, in Europe, a clear need for a legally binding definition of restoration has been identified. The recent release of a proposed regulation targeted to Nature restoration includes a legal restoration definition for the first time, partially resolving this issue within the European Union.
At the Global level the recent COP 15 Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework GBF) not only includes a target devoted to restoration, including specific recognition of inland waters (Target 2), but it also mentions the need and important role of technical and scientific cooperation (including through South- South, North-South and triangular cooperation) to effectively implement the goals and targets of the framework, particularly in developing countries (Target 20). Furthermore, the GBF clearly states that biodiversity-related conventions and other multilateral environmental agreements, are invited to prepare thematic capacity-building and development action plans for specific targets or groups of related targets, and to develop dedicated global, regional and subregional programmes to implement those thematic plans (point 8).
The expected result from the implementation of this commitment is a more effective and efficient implementation of restoration practices around the global in its societal dimensions (legal, judicial and executive) promoting rapid regeneration capacity of in-land ecosystems.","Society for Ecological Restoration

YOUNGO commits to providing guidance to its member organizations and individuals on the use and management of water resources in their local communities through the mutual exchange of information and best practices. It also aims to support youth for SDG 6 action through capacity building in the nexus of water and biodiversity. From the perspective of mitigating the transboundary risks, we also look forward to supporting young people in exploring the mitigation options and strategies for transboundary risks.
Building upon the development of the Global Youth Statement, YOUNGO is keen to incorporate more inclusive policy recommendations and youth demands on water and climate-related topics, to be shared with the stakeholders. Additionally, to further drive meaningful, impactful, and positive change through collaborative efforts, YOUNGO is ambitious to foster collaborations with other partners and youth constituencies. In line with this objective, as enshrined under the Dushanbe Water Process, YOUNGO further ensures supporting the Water and Climate Youth Development Plan and Agenda (YDPA) - keeping it at the heart of YOUNGO's action. Moving forward, in the lead-up to COP28, we look forward to supporting the local, regional, and global youth policy interventions on water, climate, and cross-cutting issues to help accelerate progress toward the achievement of the development goals.","Young people are one of the key stakeholders directly affected by policy decisions globally, yet they are not given due importance and their right to directly contribute to the process. Likewise, they play a major role to accelerate progress toward achieving Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). YOUNGO serves as a platform for global youth to amplify their voices and help drive youth development through awareness, collaboration and networking, advocacy, participation at global forums, and direct action. Moreover, aligned with the 27th Conference of Parties (COP27) cover decision - recognizing youth as “agents of change”,  it is important to put youth participation in the water and climate sector at the heart of the climate change negotiations and policy action plans.
The proposed YOUNGO commitments will not just help in advocacy and lobbying for SDG 6 action but also lead to better youth representation, ultimately resulting in positive youth engagement for water and climate action. The commitments will engage youth to commit to the proposed activities as per their capacity, providing them with a platform to transform their water and climate ambition into action. The proposed action plan will facilitate information exchange, coordination, and collaboration among the global youth on water-related activities and issues. It will also facilitate the exchange of best practices by youth communities from different regions to foster youth-youth partnerships to accelerate a bottom-up change.",,"Goal 6, Goal 11, Goal 13, Goal 16, Goal 17","6.2, 6.5, 6.a, 6.b , 11.b, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.a, 13.b, 16.3, 16.7, 16.8, 17.3, 17.6, 17.9, 17.14, 17.15, 17.17, 17.19","Wed, 03/01/2023 - 12:00","Fri, 01/31/2025 - 12:00",,0.625,0.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

Together, DU commits to conserving, enhancing and influencing over 51 million acres of wetlands and uplands during the next five years, with DUMAC committing to conserving 55,000 acres and positively influencing 350,000 acres, DUI committing to conserving 400,000 acres and enhancing 600,000 acres per year, and DUC committing to conserving over 500,000 acres of habitat and influencing over 50 million acres. Globally, North America is home to over a quarter of the world’s remaining wetlands. Thus, we have a shared responsibility to ensure the remaining wetlands are retained and restored to continue to support healthy waters for climate, people and biodiversity. DU’s planning, science, conservation and policy teams have evolved an appreciation for wetlands that began with an initial protection of key waterfowl habitat, known as the “Duck Factory” in Canada. DU’s programs embrace wetland conservation and restoration for biodiversity habitat and as natural infrastructure to protect drinking water, mitigate storm, flood, and drought impacts, store carbon, and support regenerative agriculture. Wetlands are some of the most valuable ecosystems: they store more carbon than any other ecosystem on earth – wetlands cover only 9% of the planet’s surface but account for up to 35% of the world’s carbon storage; they support incredible biodiversity, are home to 40% of the world’s fish species, and up to 30% of the world’s entire vertebrate diversity. Wetlands are a key player in nature-based climate adaptation solutions: storing floodwaters, mitigating coastal storms, recharging aquifers and supporting riverine baseflows, and providing cooling services to air and water above, in, and around them. Wetlands help protect water quality, balancing watershed hydrology, and removing pollutants from water moving through them. When we think about tackling the twin crises of climate change and biodiversity, wetlands are at the heart of the solutions. Few ecosystems do as much for our water as wetlands. Despite their value, globally, wetlands are disappearing at an alarming rate. Roughly half of the world's wetlands have been lost. Against this backdrop, the DU Family is proud to commit to growing our organization to continue to protect and restore wetlands to benefit waterfowl, biodiversity, and people across international boundaries in North America. We commit to ongoing participation as an International Partner Organization to the Ramsar Convention. We will continue to invest in international conservation planning, cross-boundary academic, industry, and governmental partnerships and Indigenous-led conservation, science, conservation, and education to deliver wetlands on the landscape.","DU’s work impacts nine SDGs: Zero Hunger, Clean Water and Sanitation, Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, Sustainable Cities and Communities, Responsible Consumption and Production, Climate Action, Life Below Water, Life on Land and Partnerships for the Goals. Our commitments will accelerate progress towards these SDGs. In addition to our overall habitat goals, we commit to leveraging decades of expertise to strategically restore wetlands in highly altered landscapes to optimize their value to communities and wildlife through cross-boundary conservation planning, science, partnership and Indigenous-led conservation, and education programs. Since the 1930s, DU’s conservation planning efforts have focused on waterfowl breeding habitats. Many decades later, we understand that to secure wetlands for waterfowl, we need to focus on the benefits of these same wetland systems to people, including flood resilience, water scarcity and water quality. We also engage in expanded program and policy arenas to achieve our vision. Our expertise in securing and delivering wetlands has positioned us at the forefront of natural infrastructure partnership and implementation. We commit to this alignment and to deliver mapping and conservation planning tools in the forms of wetland inventories for Canada, the US and Mexico to understand rates and spatial extent of wetland loss and to target restoration opportunities that are likely to succeed. Our science teams commit to cooperate across boundaries to guide conservation implementation to protect valuable international assets. In the Great Lakes region, we are supporting the international fight to improve water quality and reduce harmful algal blooms in Western Lake Erie by monitoring and modeling phosphorus dynamics on the landscape and delivering wetland restorations as nature-based solutions. We continue to advance the protection of coastal Great Lakes wetlands, among the most threatened and vulnerable habitat types that support water quality improvement. We are also investigating greenhouse gas balances in restored wetlands in that same geography and across the US and Canada. We are restoring playa habitat in the Southern Great Plains to improve Ogallala Aquifer recharge. We also are working in partnership to secure 300,000 acres of mangroves, two communities, and wintering habitat for 84% of the continent’s blue winged teal population in the Yucatan in Mexico that are being threatened by altered littoral transport and coastal erosion. We work collaboratively to support Indigenous Peoples' relationship with the land through the establishment of Indigenous Protected and Conserved Areas like the Seri´s Nation in Sonora México and the Ts'udé Nilįné Tuyeta, a 10,060 square kilometer wetland-dense area in the Northwest Territories. DU’s education programs strive to raise awareness around the importance of wetlands both in and out of the classroom and include programs such as the Youth Advisory Council in Canada, our ecology conservation and management certification in the US, and Teaching the Teachers Environmental Education and conservation management training for resource professionals in Mexico and Latin America.

It has established 64 projects and core teams and 76 observation sites to address these objectives and is managed by a Strategic Management Committee drawn from multiple universities and government and advised by an International Advisory Committee, an Indigenous Advisory Committee, and a User Committee.  Ultimate decision-making is by an Oversight Committee formed of Vice Presidents Research from the four core partner universities: Saskatchewan, Waterloo, McMaster and Wilfrid Laurier.","It has helped establish Canadian global leadership in developing water solutions for cold regions and has become the largest and most cited grouping of academic water scientists in the world. GWF has improved the scientific underpinning that supports disaster warning from floods, droughts, and water quality degradation episodes and through new code and computer technologies, is delivering state-of-the-art prediction systems. The programme continues to diagnose the varied dimensions of changing water futures under climate, water resources development and ecosystem change and has built the models that can predict these futures. It is synthesizing assessments of water futures and deploying models to predict the impacts of changing water on people, the environment, and the economy.  It has shown that evidence-informed decision-making supports appropriate and therefore sustainable water access and management solutions – solutions that are appropriate to water quality and quantity, environmental conditions, and available resources.  GWF has engaged diverse experts and individuals in the research design, implementation, and evaluation to bridge knowledge generation with knowledge application.  We have demonstrated that diversity is a catalyst for innovation and leads to more inclusive solutions.  We have found that this diversity must cut across disciplines, knowledge systems, sectors, stakeholders, and rights holders.  GWF research is thereby ready to contribute to inclusive and evidence-informed solutions for achieving water sustainability for Canada and around the world.

Rational
The Word Water for Peace Conference aims to promote a more inclusive practice of hydro-diplomacy in order to ensure a more peaceful and sustainable water cooperation and the integrated management and preservation of water resources. While hydro-diplomacy is traditionally understood as a last-resort defensive lever mobilising diplomats to avoid the violent escalation of conflicts over water resources, our initiative aims to expand this understanding to more positive multi-stakeholder cooperation and preservation efforts. 
Stakeholders involved
To meet this challenge, our initiative will be dedicated to building a global coalition of local water practitioners and users, political decision makers at all levels, scientists and technological entrepreneurs, and international development actors, financiers and philanthropies. Our approach relies on involving 5 key stakeholder communities, forming the 5 pillars of the World Water for Peace Conference:
1)	Local communities, who are at the forefront of preservation efforts and are key actors in solution development, awareness-raising and the training of local populations in the resilient management of ecosystems and water resources;
2)	Water practitioners and water users across sectors, as they use, impact, and manage the resource on a day-to-day basis;
3)	The scientific community and technological entrepreneurs, as scientific research and technical innovation within incubators strengthens knowledge and data of water resources, which are necessary for improved water co-management and preservation efforts;
4)	Political decision makers and existing hydro-diplomacy cooperation frameworks, e.g. River Basin Organisations, as these provide the necessary backing to smaller scale initiative and offer insights into how transboundary cooperation might organise itself around the sustainable management and preservation of water common resource;
5)	Philanthropies and financiers, as funds are needed to scale up these local initiatives and new sustainable finance mechanisms (e.g. blue/green finance) need to be established to support water cooperation frameworks.
The World Water for Peace Conference will gather the actors and sectors involved in the initiative’s 5 pillars to establish common areas of action, raise existing challenges, bolster cooperation and ties between the different actors and sectors.
The Bridge Tank will serve as the secretariat to the Word Water for Peace Initiative and Conference. Benefiting from active members from diverse skills, geographies and experiences, we shall make use of the ties we have built over the years across sectors, communities, and countries and build on our position at the crossroads between the political sphere and the scientific community to host this platform. 
Relevance
This initiative’s approach to hydro-diplomacy will start by supporting these efforts in West Africa, particularly in the Fouta Djallon highlands, where the sources of some of the region’s largest rivers are found, e.g. the Senegal River, the Gambia River, the Niger River, which feed 300 million people across the region. These highlands and the river sources they harbour are endangered by the actions of local populations and the effects of climate change.","The renewed and enlarged understanding of hydro-diplomacy the Word Water for Peace Conference will promote contributes to Goal 6 of the SDGs by first and foremost working to foster water cooperation and ensuring availability and sustainable management of water. But this sustainable management of water resource is also an important component of Goal 2 and 15, as the promotion of sustainable agriculture and agroforestry practices is a key component of the preservation of freshwater ecosystems, forests, and drylands. Recognising the importance of climate change in endangering water resources, this initiative will help improve awareness raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning (found in Goal 13). By working to reduce pressure on water resources and the subsequent social tensions that might arise, this initiative actively contributes to promoting peace, cooperation, and inclusive societies for sustainable development, as stated in Goal 16.",Initiative for the Future of Great Rivers,"Goal 2, Goal 6, Goal 13, Goal 15, Goal 16, Goal 17","2.4 , 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 13.1, 13.3, 15.1, 16.6, 16.7, 16.a, 17.1, 17.3, 17.6, 17.7","Mon, 12/19/2022 - 12:00","Wed, 03/22/2028 - 12:00","https://thebridgetank.org/en/2022/12/19/hydro-diplomacy-the-bridge-tank…

Every Chief in Canada is entitled to be a member of the Assembly, and the National Chief is elected by the Chiefs in Canada, who in turn are elected by their citizens. The AFN has 634 member nations within its Assembly. The role and function of the AFN is to serve as a nationally delegated forum for determining and harmonizing effective, collective, and co-operative measures on any subject matter that the First Nations delegate for review, study, response, or action, and to advance the aspirations of First Nations. 
The AFN Infrastructure and Safe Drinking Water Sector’s central initiative is continuing to press the Government of Canada to work with First Nations towards achieving SDG 6, to ensure that all First Nations enjoy the UN-affirmed human right to safe drinking water and sanitation. However, compared to most Canadians, access to safe drinking water and sanitation is a human right that too many First Nations still lack, contributing negatively to First Nations health, education, and economic development outcomes. As of February 3, 2023, there remains 32 long-term drinking water advisories in effect in 28 First Nations communities, which are advisories that have been in place for a minimum of one year, with some spanning decades. 
This initiative has been directed by the First Nations-in-Assembly, through multiple Resolutions over the last decade, which directs the AFN’s mandates, including AFN Resolution 53/2019 Human Right to Safe Drinking Water and Resolution 01/2019 First Nations Treaty and Inherent Rights to Water. This initiative will be achieving through the following activities: 1) Sustained advocacy towards urging Canada to respect First Nations rights to jurisdiction, management, and self-determination over their lands and water; 2) Advancing the implementation and ensuring that First Nations have the proper resources needed to carry out First Nations-led policies and solutions related to safe, clean, and reliable drinking water and adequate sanitation; 3) urging the Canadian government to commit to sustainable, predictable and reliable funding for all water and wastewater assets and activities. 
Implementation: Strategies, direction, progress, and challenges towards achieving this initiative will be discussed and decided by First Nations during engagement sessions and by Chiefs at annual assemblies of First Nations leadership, including dedicated dialogue sessions on water issues, as well as at the AFN National Water Symposium. The AFN will continue to host regular annual forums and engagement sessions, open to all First Nations across Canada to work collaboratively and regularly on water issues. Feedback received during these engagement sessions will inform the AFN’s advocacy objectives on safe drinking water and sanitation related matters. The AFN will press Canada to adopt a human rights-based approach to sustainable development that aligns with the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and the 2030 Agenda. The AFN will press Canada to be responsive to First Nations priorities and the full implementation of its legal obligations regarding water.","The AFN’s initiative on ensuring that all First Nations have access to safe, clean, reliable, and sufficient drinking water and adequate sanitation is directly aligned with SDG 6 and Canada’s broader commitments to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the 2030 Agenda. Our work on this initiative continues to be guided by UNDRIP, particularly Articles 25 and 32. 
Lack of safe, clean, and reliable drinking water and adequate infrastructure is a significant factor in forcing First Nations to leave their homes and move off-reserve, due to the health, educational and employment-related consequences of the lack of access. This is particularly significant for First Nations women and girls, who are the sacred keepers of water and have inherent responsibilities as caretakers to protect water. The Final Report of the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls identified the First Nations’ water and housing crisis as a source of violence against First Nations’ women, girls and 2SLGBTQQIA+ people and called upon all governments to uphold their social and economic rights and to immediately ensure that Indigenous peoples have access to safe housing, clean drinking water, and adequate food.
If the Canadian government guaranteed access to safe drinking and adequate sanitation for all First Nations, this would allow First Nations to enjoy a good quality of life on their respective traditional territories, as this begins with clean, fresh, and accessible sources of water and access to adequate sanitation, which promotes positive mental and physical health outcomes and fosters prosperity and economic development. 
We are committed to working with our allies around the world and in partnership with the Canadian government to address the global water and sanitation crisis and ensure access to clean drinking water for all First Nations in Canada and to close the infrastructure and funding gap that is a barrier to many First Nations to be able to enjoy their right to safe and affordable drinking water and sanitation. 
Through our initiative, we continue to urge Canada to recognize First Nations’ rights to water and to self-determination. Implementing First Nations rights and priorities in respect to water will also further accelerate progress on SDG 10 – Reducing Inequalities within countries (Canada), and because of the special role and responsibilities First Nations women have to water, this initiative can also accelerate progress on SDG 5 - Achieving equality and empowering all (First Nations) women and girls.",,"Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 10","5.2, 6.1 , 6.b","Fri, 03/31/2023 - 12:00","Sun, 03/31/2024 - 12:00",AFN Resolutions 01/2019 and and 53/2019 - https://www.afn.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/2019-AGA-Resolutions.pdf,0.25,0.4444444444444444,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

The ME Strategy will directly benefit (internally) ONWA staff, membership and the Indigenous women and communities supported through ONWA’s direct services and membership-delivered services and supports. Externally, broader Indigenous communities, other organizations and the public both nationally and internationally will benefit from ONWA’s increased advocacy, knowledge-sharing, greening-efforts, and capacity building.",Canada,North America,"ONWA’s membership resolved that ONWA be leaders in the protection of ME and continue to pursue and advocate for the rights of ME pursuant to the Declaration of the Rights of ME so that we may fulfill our obligation to maintain harmony and balance for Seven Generations to come. Through our 2021-31 Strategic Picture, ONWA is committed to developing an internal and external ME Strategy that reflects Indigenous women’s responsibilities, traditional ecological knowledge, and practices with measurable impacts, acknowledging our ancestors, future generations, and all our relations. The development of our Strategy aligns with our membership’s resolutions and our ongoing support of local grassroots level activities. Our Water Commission Toolkit created in 2014 to support local water protectors in their advocacy is an example of this work. 
ONWA is developing the ME Strategy with feedback from our membership and Indigenous women and girls across Ontario and through engagement with national and international water and land protectors. We understand that to be a national and international leader, and to make real systemic change for Indigenous women, we will always begin with land, water, and ceremony. In doing so, we will demonstrate the strength of our culture and continue the healing and wellness that ceremony and land and water-based practices have brought to Indigenous women for thousands of years.
The ME Strategy will honour our traditional and sacred teachings from Mother Earth and guide us in the protection of the natural environment through ceremony, knowledge mobilization, and traditional practices. Water and land-based healing and generational knowledge transfer have been the traditional and inherent roles and responsibilities of Indigenous women since time immemorial. The ME Strategy intends to support Indigenous women and girls through capacity building, systemic change, advocacy, and through the creation of safe spaces for land-based, trauma informed, and culturally safe healing practices. ONWA will strive to become a Centre of Excellence in the work to protect the environment and address climate change. We will model the change we want to see and build capacity for others (membership, youth, partners) to do the same. Our work will continue to acknowledge the leadership of all Indigenous women land- and water-protectors who have been at the forefront of action in protecting Mother Earth, including the women of Grassy Narrows (who spoke previously at the UN in 2016) who have been working to protect the waterways on their traditional lands and home community despite a lack of access to clean, healthy water.
The ME Strategy acknowledges Indigenous women across the lifecycle have shared responsibility to protect, support, and care for the natural environment and all our non-human relations. This perspective is foundational to our future as Indigenous peoples and a central part of healing from the impacts of colonization and intergenerational trauma. As Indigenous women, we will use our traditional teachings and wisdom to heal the harms against Mother Earth. Indigenous women understand their responsibility to protect the air, land, and water.","ONWA’s Mother Earth Strategy directly contributes to accelerating SDGs 5, 6, and 15.
The climate crisis is impacting the health, safety, security, and ways of life of Indigenous communities, while also deepening existing conditions of inequality for Indigenous women, their families, and communities. With 90% of disasters now classified as climate or weather related, Indigenous communities and their territories face heightened risks related to the safety and sustainability of their lands and water systems. As stewards of their lands and waterways, Indigenous women are at the forefront of action defending their territories from irreversible harm. The traditional knowledge and cultural values Indigenous women hold are key to the protection and sustainability of the natural environment for all future generations in all communities. With this dire context in mind, Indigenous women as water carriers must have the safety to fulfil their obligation to ensure that the land and water are clean, accessible, unpolluted, and continues to fulfill its spiritual roles for our communities, grandchildren, and future generations.
ONWA’s ME Strategy will support several initiatives to reclaim Indigenous women’s access to traditional practices throughout their healing journey. The ME Strategy will provide Indigenous women and girls the ability to reconnect with their culture and Mother Earth, and to reclaim their inherent cultural roles and their rightful place as leaders within the community. Substantive and meaningful solutions to address access to clean water and a healthy environment cannot be put forward until the systemic issues that impact Indigenous women, girls, and their communities are understood, addressed, and remedied. Doing the work to develop our ME Strategy will allow for Indigenous women and girls to gather and heal as a collective by leveraging cultural practices and generational knowledge transfer. Through the ME Strategy, we will build Indigenous women’s capacity by providing access to cultural and healing activities that not only support their healing but help them to share and teach their children and grandchildren. Indigenous women are the leaders in their families and in leading their families to wellness through the protection of Mother Earth, the health and wellbeing of Indigenous women and their communities will improve as a whole.
Indigenous women who take up the role of land, water, or environmental defenders are well versed in establishing and practicing ongoing tactics and strategies to protect their children, families, and communities from the impacts of global climate change. The facilitation of knowledge-sharing between Indigenous women to strengthen global and local solidarity between Indigenous women in all countries must be protected. Through the updating of our Water Commission Toolkit as part of ME Strategy development, we expect that current and future generations of water protectors will be supported in the ongoing resistance and remediation of climate change and environmental degradation. The knowledge and expertise of Indigenous women and girls is vast, and through their positions as experts of traditional knowledge, our ME will be protected.","ONWA's membership consists of 12 Chapters (incorporated Indigenous women’s organizations providing frontline services) and 21 Councils (grassroots groups of Indigenous women supporting community development models), representative of First Nations, Inuit, Metis, and non-status Indigenous women across Ontario.","Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 15","5.1 , 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 , 5.5, 5.6, 5.a, 5.b, 5.c , 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5, 15.6, 15.7, 15.8, 15.9, 15.a, 15.b, 15.c","Fri, 03/31/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 04/01/2031 - 12:00","• ONWA – About Us, provides an outline of our values, strategic issues model, organizational structure, and 2021-2031 Strategic Picture: https://www.onwa.ca/about

Our organization partners with many nonprofit organizations and nongovernment organizations that work internationally to promote the Sustainable Development Goals; through these partnerships, our goal is to educate youth, providing opportunities for involvement and increasing their passion and knowledge on these important and sensitive topics. Ways by which we do this are by hosting online workshops with partner organizations, workshops that both offer immense educational information from experts and provide opportunities for involvement (these workshops are promoted through international networks); our organization also focuses on increasing access to Model United Nations in Nigeria as an educational aid through our ""MUNI Kickstarters"" program. As part of this commitment, our organization strives to include further focus on SDG 6 and its targets in our programming. Specifically, our organization has already begun planning workshops with nonprofit organizations focused on SDG 6 to provide information of the issue of water security's severity to youth around the world; in debating this topic in Model United Nations simulations, students are encouraged to and given the opportunities necessary to help formulate potential means by which the issues at hand can be mitigated.","This action will increase youth involvement in important issues, increasing student understanding of the issues and providing youth with opportunities to get involved in the issues and find solutions. Many of the SDGs will have even greater effects on future generations; thus, it is essential that youth have the opportunities to provide input on these issues and be fully involved. With more active and young minds considering the SDGs and growing in devotion to the causes, this furthers SDG 17 -- the international community is better able to unite behind the goals.

            Make all drinking water lead free","Anyone, especially children and pregnant women, at risk of being exposed to lead from drinking water – particularly those in marginalized communities; governments; development partners; financial institutions; philanthropic organizations; international organizations; analytical laboratories; private sector; manufacturers; suppliers.","Ghana, South Africa, Uganda",Global,"Lead is a potent neurotoxin that impairs brain function and irreversibly harms children’s cognitive development. No safe level of lead exposure has been identified. Approximately 1 in every 3 children worldwide (about 800 million children) currently have elevated blood lead levels which may be a significant factor in intellectual disabilities, decreased IQ, and in reducing lifelong earning potential. This makes lead not only a serious and significant public health threat but a key environmental risk factor that can exacerbate inequalities in marginalized groups. Addressing this challenge will require concerted efforts by our cross-sectoral partner organizations, including Member States, UN agencies, non-governmental organizations, WASH implementers, water component manufacturers, and academia.
Water is a significant, but relatively easy to address, source of lead exposure. The primary source of lead in drinking-water is lead-leaching parts and materials in water systems, including piped networks, plumbing and fixtures in buildings (e.g., homes and schools), and small water systems (e.g., hand pumps and their components). A WHO Technical Brief issued in August 2022 noted that “Prevention is the most effective action to reduce exposure to lead through drinking water” and encouraged global action. 
We are launching this global initiative by bringing together a coalition of government, private sector, and non-government partners focused on reducing morbidity and mortality associated with lead exposure from drinking water. Our cross-sectoral partnership has three objectives:
1.	 Secure a commitment from governments, intergovernmental and non-governmental organizations, multi-lateral financial institutions, and partners in the private sector to eliminate the use of lead-leaching parts in new drinking water systems by 2030 and to progressively work towards making all drinking water lead free by 2040. The pledge commitment and list of founding partners can be accessed on the GlobalLeadFreeWater.org website.
2.	GlobalLeadFreeWater.org will become a knowledge hub that summarizes the knowledge and tools to support national governments and implementing partners seeking to establish, monitor, and enforce new regulations and standards, to improve water quality testing, and to implement reforms in the design, construction, building, and commissioning of drinking water supply systems.
3.	We will work to develop and codify international standards and guidelines on lead in drinking water and parts used in drinking water systems.  And,
4.	We will invite other states and organizations to be partners on the pledge and broader initiative and collectively advocate for the progressive elimination of lead and other toxic metals in drinking water systems.","As part of our global commitment to provide water that is free from microbial hazards and priority chemical contaminants that impact human health, this global initiative will work towards preventing lead-leaching from new drinking water systems by 2030 and making all drinking water lead free by 2040. The partners on the Global Pledge to Protect Drinking Water from Lead have agreed to work collectively to protect drinking water from lead through the following actions:
•	We will ensure that all new water systems are constructed with products and materials that meet international standards for lead-leaching, material safety, and performance.
•	For existing water systems that may contain lead-leaching materials, we will develop and implement plans for periodic water lead monitoring and data sharing, including the transparent communication of monitoring results to communities served.
•	We will investigate water systems reporting lead levels at 10 ppb (the WHO guideline value) or above to identify contamination sources and implement necessary interim or long-term remedial measures to reduce human exposure.  
•	Support communities to reduce or eliminate exposure to lead through education and action such as designating safe taps for drinking and cooking.
•	To implement these commitments, we will:
a.	Support the adoption of national policies and regulations based on international standards and testing/certification requirements for products and materials used in drinking water systems that address lead-leaching, material safety, and performance.
b.	Support manufacturing of products and materials used in drinking water systems that meet international standards for lead-leaching, material safety, and performance.
c.	Support affordable access to fittings, fixtures and filters that meet international standards for lead in drinking water.
d.	Support the development of low-cost technologies to enable widespread testing for lead in drinking water and materials to better understand the sources, impacts, and mitigation/remediation of lead contamination in drinking water.
e.	Support the training and certification of professionals to oversee the design and construction of safe drinking water systems.
f.	Support and develop national and local laboratory and monitoring capacity to assess and monitor lead in drinking water and materials to support implementation of these commitments.
g.	Support high-quality research to better understand and identify sources, impacts, and effective prevention and remediation methods and approaches to minimize harm from lead in drinking water.","Governments of Ghana, Uganda, and South Africa; World Health Organization; UNICEF; World Vision; WaterAid; International Association of Plumbing and Mechanical Officials; Conrad N.

Despite the ubiquity of diversity and inclusion statements in the Sustainable Development Agenda and in global water governance spaces, this continues to be the case. 
Public and community water management and service delivery have been simultaneously starved of funding while water commodification, privatization and financialization are promoted as the silver bullet to achieve SDG 6, despite the overwhelming body of evidence that the latter strategy is a failure.
Informed by the experiences of water defenders and communities on the frontlines of struggles for water justice, we commit to continuing to bring evidence of the benefits of public and community partnerships for achieving access to water and sanitation for all and the sustainable management of water resources and ecosystems, and for addressing the harms caused by the intensifying turn towards the private sector.","This initiative will amplify and integrate experiences emerging from struggles to protect, improve and expand public and community water management and service delivery, which are well evidenced to improve equity and sustainability. It will continue to grow the large body of evidence and practical experience demonstrating the success of a diversity of creative and proactive forms of water management and service delivery alternatives to achieve access to water and sanitation for all.
It will also continue to add to the overwhelming body of evidence that water privatization—including private financing—in all its forms is a failure, more expensive than public options, undemocratic and lacking transparency, and no more efficient—even in narrowly technical and financial, let alone social, terms—than public provision, while exacerbating inequality. In doing so, it will continue to uncover human rights abuses and violations committed by states and corporations in the water, sanitation and related sectors, contributing to efforts to hold these actors to account in the context of weak, voluntary governance regimes.
In short, this initiative seeks to accelerate the achievement of SDG 6 and numerous related goals by elevating the experiences and practices of citizen and community participation in water governance and service delivery, collaborations and partnerships between public and community organizations and companies, and between organized communities themselves. These partnerships seek radical changes in decision-making systems based on new socio-ecological agreements around water, which include the various forms and practices of managing water and involve relationships between a variety of social actors across sectors based on respect, integration, participation, solidarity and inter-institutional, organizational and community exchange.","People's Water Forum (Africans Rising; African Water Commons Collective, South Africa; Africa Water Justice Network; Agua para Todxs, Mexico; Asociación Comunitaria Unida por el Agua y la Agricultura, El Salvador; Asociación Sostenibilidad, Equidad y Derechos Ambientales, Colombia; Blue Community Switzerland; Blue Community Berlin; Coalición de Organizaciones Mexicanas por el Derecho Humano al Agua; Corporación Ecológica y Cultural Penca de Sábila, Colombia; Corporate Accountability and Public Participation Africa; Ecumenical Water Network, International; End Water Poverty; European Water Movement; Food and Water Watch, North America; Fundación Abril, Bolivia; GRÜNE LIGA e.V., Germany; Ingeniería Sin Fronteras (ISF), Spain; Inicijativa Pravo na Vodu (Right to Water), Serbia; Public Services International; KRuHA (People’s Coalition for the Rights to Water), Indonesia; Oakland Institute, US; Observatorio Nacional de los Derechos al Agua y Saneamiento (ONDAS), Brazil; Plataforma Acuerdos Público Comunitarios de Las Américas, Latin America; Red Agua Pública, Spain; Red Ecuménica del Agua – Consejo Mundial del Agua,  International; Red Vigilancia Interamericana para la Defensa y Derecho al Agua, Latin America; Transnational Institute).","Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 4, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 8, Goal 9, Goal 10, Goal 11, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 15, Goal 17","1.2 , 1.3 , 1.4, 1.5, 1.b, 2.3, 2.4 , 3.2, 3.3, 4.a, 5.2, 5.4 , 5.5, 5.a, 5.c , 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 8.5, 8.6, 8.8, 9.1, 9.4, 9.a, 10.2, 11.1 , 11.5, 11.6, 11.a, 11.b, 12.2, 13.1, 13.3, 15.1, 15.3, 17.1, 17.2",,,,0.875,0.4444444444444444,0.0,0.75,1.0,0.6043956043956067

            Invest in water and wastewater infrastructure, including but not limited to: water and wastewater utilities, treatment and reuse facilities, transportation and storage, and digital solutions.",,United States of America,North America,"Sciens Water was conceived in 2015 and the Sciens Water Opportunities Fund launched in 2018 to make control investments in private companies that address the biggest problems facing U.S. water infrastructure today, with a focus on utilities, transmission and distribution, and wastewater treatment and recycling.
Sciens Water looks for opportunities where it can apply value-added strategies to help water and wastewater businesses grow into leading national platforms, while increasing the quality of services delivered.
Sciens is a fundamental research-driven investor that identifies pockets of opportunity in the water sector that benefit from long-term macro factors but are uncovered, under-researched and misunderstood, and consequently under-capitalized by the capital markets. Sciens makes control investments in the U.S. water infrastructure and related companies where it can generate both yield and capital appreciation through application of value-added strategies, developed through over 25 years of private equity investment experience.
In addition to generating financial returns for its investors, Sciens seeks to make investments that help to solve the big challenges facing the U.S. water industry:
1.	Aging and Degraded Infrastructure
2.	Resource Scarcity
3.	Threats to the Environment and Human Health","Water and wastewater infrastructure must be developed and modernized in order to meet Sustainable Development Goal 6 (Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all), and the development of this infrastructure will also bring the United States closer to reaching SDG 8 (Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all) and SDG 9 (Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation).
There is a $1 trillion dollar funding gap for U.S. water infrastructure, with more than half of that needed to replace or repair existing infrastructure. While the U.S. federal government has increased funding for repair and replacement, the gap will not be closed by federal funding alone. 
While the U.S. ranks highly compared to other nations on drinking water and wastewater services, persistent deferred maintenance of utility systems and growing populations in the South and West requires a significant amount of investment to update or replace aging systems (SDG 9). Access to water and wastewater services is a public health issue and an economic issue (SDG 8). Households that lack access to clean, safe drinking water spend more time and money acquiring potable water, time that could be spent on educations, careers, or supporting other family members. Investing in water and wastewater infrastructure thus promotes technological advances in infrastructure, health of communities, economic outcomes of communities, and the delivery of water and sanitation services to those who need it most. 
Sciens Water will continue to invest in water and wastewater infrastructure, including new technologies, to repair, replace, and develop water and wastewater systems that meet the changing needs of the United States. In doing so, we will move towards a sustainable and water-secure future, ensuring that all have access to water and wastewater services by 2030.",,"Goal 6, Goal 8, Goal 9",,,,,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

The UL4BC also provide civil society actors a platform to raise their voices, to advocate for the human right to water.

We will support incubation and acceleration programs and carry out innovative impact investments into WASH enterprises with an added value for climate change mitigation and adaptation, health, gender equality and other SDG’s.
4.	We will expand our support for the delivery of WASH services that last. Therefore, we will focus on channeling efforts and resources towards understanding where the gaps and weaknesses are in the broader WASH system and take collective action to make the whole system stronger.

            Strengthening of Parliamentary Water Caucuses in fifteen legislatures","If the work of a Parliamentary Water Caucus is successful in a given country, the key beneficiaries of its work will be the people of that country, who will see increased, sustained, equitable, and affordable access to water security, sanitation, and hygiene in their communities. The relevant ministries (WASH, health, education, public works) will likely also benefit from increased budgets and stronger laws for WASH. Lastly, tying this into SDG16, the social contract (the two-way street between a people and their government) will be strengthened as people understand the value they get for their taxes. Increased access to water security can help pave that two-way street, making possible a more participatory governance, and a more peaceful society.","India, Liberia, Malawi, Mexico, Niger, Nigeria, Pakistan, Senegal, South Africa, Uganda, Ibero-American Network of Life Cycle Assesment, United States of America",Global,"If we are to significantly accelerate progress toward global water security in the tight timeframe required by the SDGs, we need to start acting differently. In the water sector, our belief is that the role of national and subnational elected political leaders across the globe is under-recognized and under-appreciated. 
Our commitment, “Launching and Strengthening Parliamentary Water Caucuses,” is to do just that: to launch and strengthen informal associations of Members of Parliament focused on water security and sanitation in their countries. In as many countries as possible, the Members of these Caucuses will pursue a common legislative agenda in their parliaments: accelerated progress on water security, sanitation, and hygiene in their country. A Parliamentary Water Caucus typically undertakes activities in Parliament designed to promote access to safe, affordable, and sustainable water, including the consideration of new laws, stronger regulatory environments, and increased funding (from both domestic and international sources). 
Water Caucuses are intended to educate and inform members of Parliament regarding the positive impact they can have on their country’s WASH coverage. Caucuses also empower those legislators to collaborate with each other and their constituents to prioritize water investments that will make families, communities, and their nation healthier and stronger, and make important contributions to peace and security within and across borders. 
A Parliamentary Water Caucus is not an island. Caucus Members often work hand in hand with allies in civil society and the relevant technical ministries in their country. This working relationship has been referred to as a three-legged stool, including the Members of Parliament, civil society leaders, and the technical ministries who stand to benefit from the success of the Caucuses. Key stakeholders can also include the media, the private sector, associations, and many others.","The most important impact of Parliamentary Water Caucuses is to clarify the linkage between SDG6 (water) and SDG16 (peace, justice, and strong institutions). Strong governance, including Parliamentary Water Caucuses, will increase water access. Increased water access will prove to citizens, voters, taxpayers that a government is holding up its end of the bargain. The social contract is a two-way street between people and their government, and water security is a fundamental, demand-responsive component of that social contract. 
More tangibly, the key impact of a successful Parliamentary Water Caucus over the medium- to long-term will be increased levels of safe, affordable, and sustained access to water security, sanitation, and hygiene for the citizens of that country. Intermediate outputs will be determined by each Water Caucus according to its country-specific priorities. Those outputs are expected to include new and stronger laws, tightened regulatory environments, increasingly open and transparent budgeting processes, increased budgets (prioritizing marginalized communities), and others. 
Other impacts will likely include:
-	The relevant ministries (WASH, health, education, public works) will benefit from increased budgets and stronger laws for WASH.
-	Water will assume a more prominent role in dialogues with the international development and diplomatic communities, and with neighboring countries.
-	Over the long-run, an increase in domestic resource mobilization is expected, with public financial support eventually replacing donor support. 
The initial focus of legislative Water Caucuses will be primarily on a national level, country by country. However, efforts are underway (e.g. Nigeria, Pakistan, India) to launch such legislative caucuses at a provincial/state level as well.","Our commitment, “Launching and Strengthening Parliamentary Water Caucuses,” will count on partners from across the globe for its success. 
First and foremost, our most important partners are Members of Parliament themselves, who are the ultimate decision-makers for the laws, policies, budgets and programs that will help to accelerate progress in the global water sector.  However, Members of Parliament will need the support of other partners:
-	Civil society leaders, organizations, and networks, with a particular focus on youth and gender
-	Parliamentary staff and assistants
-	The private sector
-	Media
-	The international donor community","Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 6, Goal 16","16.1, 16.2, 16.3, 16.5, 16.6, 16.7, 16.8, 16.a, 2.4 , 3.3, 3.9, 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b","Wed, 06/01/2022 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2024 - 12:00","In March 2023, Honorable Jacqueline Amongin published a helpful article in The Parliamentarian, the key publication of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association.

            Establishment and distribution of the Freshwater Action Fund ($1 billion across Canada)",All people who live in Canada.,"Canada, United States of America",North America,"1. Build a Canada Water Agency, based on the five foundational pillars, that leads collaborative efforts involving all levels of government, engages Canadians, and leverages Canada’s wealth of knowledge in water science and technology. The new Canada Water Agency will:
- Meaningfully advance the federal government’s commitment to reconciliation with Indigenous Peoples;
create and mobilize the knowledge – both Western and Indigenous science and knowledge – needed to predict and respond to water problems and opportunities;
strengthen shared water decision-making and management;
-Emphasize the importance of watershed boundaries in all water decision-making; and
- Play a key role addressing outdated water laws and policies.
2. Renew the Canada Water Act, in collaboration with provincial, territorial, and Indigenous governments. The Canada Water Act is our primary federal freshwater legislation, yet it has not been meaningfully updated since it was passed in 1970. To ensure that the renewed Act is consent-based and rooted in nation-to-nation relationships, we propose a co-drafting process with Indigenous Nations.
3. A historic investment of $1 billion over 5 years in the Freshwater Action Plan
A historic investment of $1 billion over 5 years in the health of our waters. Across Canada, community organizations, Indigenous communities and local governments are ready to implement an abundance of freshwater projects that will create much-needed local jobs while strengthening our water security, climate resilience, and the overall quality of life for all people in Canada. The Freshwater Action Plan will provide the needed resources to ensure these essential projects are implemented in communities across the country.","This initiative will foster the creation of collaborative governance mechanisms and policies through the creation of a Federal Canada Water Agency and the renewal of the Canada Water Act. Such reforms will aim to protect and manage freshwater at the watershed levels across Canada and the US (SDG 6), particularly in the face of a climate-impacted future (SDG 13). They will be built upon collaboration and innovation (6.5) and incorporate meaningful change to protect watersheds into national strategy and law (13). Moreover, such policies will inspire broader benefits for the health of the entire watershed, including terrestrial ecosystems (SDG 15). Most importantly, the collaborative governance model will make meaningful steps toward reconciliation in Canada and encourage inclusive cooperation at the municipal, provincial, federal and global levels.","•	Forum for Leadership on Water,

The Freshwater Challenge aims at leveraging the support needed to bring 300,000 km of rivers and 350 million hectares of wetlands under restoration by 2030. Conservation International (CI) will contribute to this process both through its work with countries to directly restore freshwater ecosystems, and through its work assimilating data and developing tools, such as the Freshwater Health Index that assesses the watershed’s ecology, the watershed’s capacities to deliver ecosystem services, and water governance. The Freshwater Challenge also aims to identify priority areas for freshwater ecosystem restoration that are essential for biodiversity, climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction. CI will provide input from its own work on riparian restoration, including identifying opportunities for embracing freshwater within CI’s existing restoration projects. CI will also communicate the Freshwater Challenge to its country partners working on freshwater projects. Specifically, we are asking participating organizations to state their commitment to advance toward healthy watersheds by 2025.

It was endorsed in 2018 by the IHP Intergovernmental Council to promote water awareness and sustainability education worldwide (Resolution n.5-XXIII of UNESCO-IHP).
WAMU-NET’s mission is to foster new visions for more far-sighted management of water and reach larger audiences through water education activities. Thanks to enhanced activities based on water awareness, it’s possible to promote innovation and adaptation strategies, and better co-existence between humans and the biosphere as a whole.
WAMU-NET is established to re-connect people with all forms of water legacy (both natural and cultural heritage) and highlight through holistic approaches “the natural, social, cultural, artistic, and spiritual dimensions related to water”. For this reason, WAMU-NET aims at supporting cooperation among institutions, museums and people to repair our deteriorated relationship with the most precious element for life and implement new actions to build a ‘new culture of water’.
The Global Network of Water Museums is an independent non-profit NGO based in Venice, Italy. It groups 80+ institutional members from 36 countries, with a yearly average audience of approx. 50 million visitors per year. WAMU-NET is governed by its General Assembly and the Management Board. Its work is made possible by the generous support of its 80+ members.","The strategy of WAMU-NET for the Water Action Agenda is set to impact, by December 2030, a global audience of more than 500 million people. At present, the museums listed below are committed to disseminate WAMU-NET’s key messages. They count altogether an average number of 50 million visitors per year. With this figure, the expected impact over the next eight years is to reach 400 million people. Moreover, WAMU-NET's strategy is to double its membership by 2030 (from the present 80+ members to 160; thus, implementing the Resolution n.7-XXIV of UNESCO-IHP on WAMU-NET). In addition, WAMU-NET will mobilise to formally involve the National Committees of UNESCO-IHP (in 169 countries worldwide) to implement the World Inventory of water museums (IHP Resolution n.7-XXIV).
All these efforts will allow it to reach the expected target of 500 million people globally - in the process empowering awareness education, ecosystem and biodiversity protection, environmental stewardship, the sustainable use of water, and the value of water in general - in the attempt to transform the way people think, act, and behave.
WAMU-NET will mobilize additional voluntary commitments from across sectors, with a focus on holistic and transformative understanding of the value of water. All these efforts will foster behavioral shifts to drive meaningful global change and achieve the 2030 Agenda.","EUROPE >

Our programs are collective efforts and the result of partnerships with valuable organizations that help us connect with the communities.","Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Guatemala, Peru",Latin America and the Caribbean,"This Water Action Agenda is focused on Wavin’s community program in Latin America.
Orbia's Building & Infrastructure business Wavin is an innovative solutions provider for the global building and infrastructure industry. Creating long-lasting, circular and energy efficient solutions, the business is tackling some of the world’s toughest challenges relevant to ensuring safe and efficient water supplies, sanitation and hygiene, climate-resilient cities and better building performance. 
Our community program provides an additional pathway to amplify the reach of our solutions and make communities stronger in the face of the world’s most pressing challenges such as water & sanitation, and climate change. 
Wavin has several production facilities in Latin America – sometimes in regions where potable water facilities, sewer systems and other crucial infrastructure are lagging behind. Wavin is keen on supporting such regions in the development of these basic needs. Creating a positive  impact for the community results in more prosperity in the area and an increase in local entrepreneurship. It also enables Wavin to attract and attain motivated employees, support their families while securing stable conditions around the  production facility. 
In addition we are contributing to the conservation and protection of watersheds through our cooperation with the Latin American Water Funds. Since 2012, we have supported the Latin American Water Funds Partnership, providing financing, products and technical knowledge to the development of Water Funds that are in areas near our operations: Ecuador, Peru, Colombia, Brazil and Mexico.
Wavin has long standing collaborations with partner organizations (NGOs) in many countries. Each year a planning is made with the partners for the realization of new projects. Performance of projects is reviewed together with the partners.","We communicate on our impacts annually through the Orbia Impact Report. For 2022 we reported 23 WASH projects that provided water access to more than 40,000 people in Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, Ecuador, Mexico, and Peru. Including 402 clean water storage tanks with a total capacity of 221,210 liters, 54 hand-washing stations, 178 rainwater systems, and 14 biodigesters. The engineering teams also provide technical assistance to the community members on the design and implementation. 
The goal in 2023 is to implement at least an equivalent amount of projects in Latin America.

Future Earth is a global network of scientists, researchers, and innovators working towards transformation to global sustainability. We facilitate research, mobilise networks, spark innovation, and turn knowledge into action and will continue these efforts with the initiatives of this commitment: 1. The Earth Commission is the first holistic attempt to scientifically define and quantify safe and just Earth system boundaries for people and the planet, avoiding crossing irreversible tipping points. The Commission is hosted by Future Earth, the world’s largest network of sustainability scientists, and is the scientific cornerstone of the Global Commons Alliance, The Commission is completing the first global-scale effort to define safe and just Earth System boundaries for surface water and groundwater flows as well as for other Earth system domains. Boundaries for nutrient flows (nitrogen and phosphorus) are also defined, with relevance for water quality and eutrophication. The Commission introduces an Earth System justice lens to the definition of boundaries for the Earth system, including water. Such an approach ensures that boundaries reduce harm, increase human well-being, and integrate substantive and procedural justice. The work of the Earth Commission is informing the development of science-based targets for business, cities and countries through the Science Based Targets Network. 2. Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform for Water Sustainability (ISPWAS) The objective of the ISPWAS is to provide a science-based global water assessment to deliver practical and actionable solutions, and identify emerging needs for capacity development and infrastructure needs. ISPWAS has been developed by UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Hydrological Programme) and Future Earth’s Sustainable Water Future Programme in collaboration with other UN agencies and the scientific community. With the support of these two lead organisations, ISPWAS would be implemented by national entities based on the needs of Member States, grounded in an intergovernmental mechanism. 3. Water Risk Atlas The activities of all companies and organisations depend on available water resources in the regions within which they operate, and as a result have some impact on the water environment. It is important to accurately assess the dependence risks and impacts. Therefore the Water Risk Atlas provides up to date information that enables various organisations, including companies to assess current and future water risks anywhere in the world. Follow-up mechanisms The commitment of the Global Commons Alliance (GCA) to the efforts of the Earth Commission provides an opportunity for further development of safe and just boundaries as the scholarship around Earth system boundaries and Earth system justice advances. The connection to SBTN ensureS that scientific advances will lead into scientific target setting. In addition, the Commission collaborates with other components of the GCA: Systems Change Lab, that is working to monitor and promote the needed systems shifts, and Accountability Accelerator, which is strengthening accountability actors around the world. The methodologies and mechanism of the Global Water Assessment will be further elaborated in another commitment made by Sustainable Water Futures Programme, and the Water Atlas is still under development.","1. Earth Commission - The safe and just Earth system boundaries for surface and groundwater, nutrients and biodiversity will provide the foundation for a stable planet and identify where critical transformations are required to change patterns of water supply and demand. The boundaries will inform science based targets that can be developed for companies and, in the longer term, cities and countries. Together, these efforts can help humanity to stay within safe and just boundaries and meet the targets of SDG 6 to achieve a sustainable water future for all. The safe and just boundaries of the other domains that will be defined by the Earth Commission will provide a pathway to meeting other SDGs such as SDG 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, 12, 13, 14 and 15. With its holistic focus on justice and social goals, as well as the environmental goals and a whole Earth system perspective, the interlinkages are at the core of this initiative. 2. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform for Water Sustainability will bring substantial impact by helping to bridge the science-policy gap via a comprehensive knowledge base that integrates data and information from a range of sources. The resulting support for policy, regulation and decision-making around water will ensure that steps taken by governments towards the SDGs are integrated across all elements of the water system with a foundation of cutting edge science that meets the needs of Member States. 3. The Water Risk Atlas enables organisations, including businesses, to assess current and future water risks anywhere in the world. In addition to climate change, future projections of social change will be estimated in line with the Shared Socio-Economic Scenario. This will facilitate the sharing of information necessary for regional integrated water resource management, as well as the assessment of climate change impacts and the formulation of adaptation measures.","Partners in this commitment are: Earth Commission, Global Commons Alliance, Sustainable Water Futures, UNESCO The Earth Commission is the scientific cornerstone of the Global Commons Alliance, a sponsored project of Rockefeller Philanthropy Advisors, with support from Oak Foundation, MAVA, Porticus, Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, Herlin Foundation and the Global Environment Facility.

            Production of dedicated online content promoting sustainable consumption of resources (including water)",Members of the wider global community visiting our website,Ibero-American Network of Life Cycle Assesment,Global,"The overall goal is demonstrate and reinforce linkages between the achievement of SDG 6 with actions to promote sexual and reproductive health (SDG3), education (SDG4), gender equality (SDG 5) and sustainable consumptoin (SDG12). This will be undertaken in two ways: 1. Partnerships with organisations delivering services related to SDGs 3, 4 and 5 2. Education of the public and relevant stakeholders about the linkage. 1. Partnerships Population Matters' existing Empower to Plan funding progamme provides small grants to independent grassroots projects working in the fields of sexual and reproductive health and rights, gender equality and/or girls' education, including those with an environmental protection component. These projects provide resources which enable women and girls to exercise greater control over family size and avoid unwanted pregnancy, thereby paving the way for them to claim and exercise their sexual and reproductive rights, build environmental resilience and leadership, enjoy socioeconomic benefits and gain increased bodily autonomy. The reduction of unwanted pregnancy in their communities also usually leads to decreased pressure on local resources, including water. Previous partnerships have taken place in water-stressed regions. A previous recipient (KOMB GREEN Solutions) also utilised E2P funding in a project to restore the Nairobi River. 2023 project selection and grant dispersal will include evaluation of potential direct or indirect benefits in regard to environmental protection of water resources and reduction of water stress. 2. Education of the public and stakeholders Population growth is an acknowledged driver of water stress, as well as contributing to other water challenges, such as pollution and degradation of aquatic ecosystems. Unsustainable consumption levels, patterns and behaviours also prevent fulfilment of the goals of SDG 6. Population Matters will continue to educate the public to understand these relationships via our communications platforms, including website and social media. In regard to population pressure, we will do so through dedicated content highlighting the issues, including a decicated briefing. Critically, this content will emphasise how actions and investment which promote SDGs 3, 4 and 5 not only provide direct benefits to individual lives and communities, but are shown to lead to lower fertility rates and population growth. In regard to consumption, our materials highlight how consumption choices and levels contribute to water challenges, including through agricultural practices, extractive industries, manufacturing and climate change impacts. Our materials highlight the disproprtionate impact of consumption behaviour among the globally affluent, and the importance of meeting and exceeding the goals and targets of SDG 12. Our materials and outputs will specifically address water impacts within te overall consumption context.","It is not yet possible to predict the impact of the Empower to Plan partnership work as specific projects have yet to be identified. On the basis of previous projects, however, we anticipate that beneficiary communities will be better equipped to advance progress towards SDG6 for the reasons outlined above, although the ways in which they will do so will be dependent on local circumstances. In regard to our educational work, we hope to secure greater support for activities promoting SDGs 3, 4 and 5, among members of the public and stakeholders and policymakers. Our educational activities regarding consumption directly support Target 12.8, ensuring that people are equipped with the necessary knowledge to make sustainable consumption choices.

The mission of WaterStep, is to respond to critical needs for safe water and health in the developing world and disasters by working with people on the ground to evaluate and implement strategies for success, specifically,
•	Saving lives with safe water and disinfectant by empowering communities to take care of their own long-term water and sanitation needs with simple tools and effective training. 
•	Providing safe water solutions to areas impacted by disaster, arming first responders with the equipment and knowledge to support those in need. 
•	Developing creative solutions that are simple and sustainable, which can mean the difference between life and death.  
In addition to the WaterStep team of over 150 field consultants and ambassadors, WaterStep's newest initiative is to work with strategic partners to bring sustainable safe water and disinfectant to prisons (Kenya Board of Prisons), medical facilities (SANRU), refugee camps (John Dau Foundation and Swiss Red Cross), and rural communities in Ecuador (Impreza Publica del Agua). To date, WaterStep has impacted over 9 million people with access to safe water, sanitation, and WASH education & training. Our newest initiative with current and future strategic partners has a goal of impacting 100M new beneficiaries by 2030 through tools that create safe water and sanitation toward goals 6.1 and 6.2.
Utilizing WaterStep's patented ChlorineGenerator and BleachMaker technologies and tools and implemented in conjunction with strategic partners, WaterStep's WASH program includes:
1 – Safe Water Access - Installation of sustainable water purification technology using chlorination to provide safe water for distribution, water transportation tools that reduce the number of dangerous trips to wells for young girls and women, and training to rehabilitate hand pumps of existing boreholes.
2 – Disinfectant – Equipment and technology that will allow communities to produce and distribute full-strength disinfectant for disease prevention, sanitation, latrine management, and health .
3 – Training & Education – Training on hand pump repair, management of water points, use of safe water and disinfectant equipment, and education for individuals and community leaders who will scale up WASH activities to enhance community engagement and provide education on handwashing, defecation, prevention of disease, and hygiene.
WaterStep will conduct all implementation activities, programs, and monitoring evaluation activities in conjunction with invested partners, tracking activities and outcomes in Salesforce. All projects that are implemented with strategic partners will be governed by the implementing partners who will approve and be invested in each project.","WaterStep has been positively impacting lives around the world with sustainable safe water and disinfectant solutions and education for over 25 years. We continue to do this with a robust network of field consultants who take care of their own communities' water and sanitation needs. Our newest initiative, which is key to WaterStep's strategic development plan, is to partner with organizations across the globe to bring sustainable safe water and sanitation solutions, education, and comprehensive WASH solutions, allowing us to exponentially scale our impact up to 100M beneficiaries by 2030.
Because WaterStep's technologies are sustainable, affordable, and easy to implement (requiring only a 12V power source and common salt to operate), communities are educated and trained to take care of their own water and sanitation needs. Implementing these projects through partner organizations will allow our work to expand exponentially, impacting large numbers of people, very likely beyond our goal of 100M beneficiaries by 2030. Because we have the methodology in place to track outcomes, WaterStep will be able to provide quantifiable feedback to the UN on numbers of people and communities that will have access to safe water and sanitation.
Because of the simplicity and versatility of our tools, selling bleach at markets has created income opportunities for women, girls, and those in vulnerable situations, and we are motivated to bring this same opportunity to our strategic partners' communities. For example, in Kenya, women being released from prison are being trained on and provided with WaterStep's BleachMaker upon release, creating the opportunity for immediate income generation while also contributing to increasing the overall health of the community to which she returns. This is a model that is both replicable and scalable anywhere in the world and will provide many long-term benefits as it is expands to more communities through our partnerships.
We are a strong believer in partnerships that increase opportunity, access, and equity in developing countries. We know that combining the WASH expertise and technologies of WaterStep with health providers, for example, will enhance outcomes for each group's set of goals. In an increasingly complex world, these partnerships are key to ultimately breaking the cycle of inequity that lead to poverty and poor outcomes across the board.","Kenya Bureau of Prisons, SANRU, Swiss Red Cross, John Dau Foundation, Impreza Publica del Agua, Mustafa Kamal University Public Health Department, State Emergency Service of Ukraine.

            Zero impact on the forests of the sugar cane area by the use of agrochemicals and crop burns","Inhabitants of the region, girls and women and vulnerable peoples, small farmers, municipalities of the region, autochthonous fauna and flora.",Guatemala,Latin America and the Caribbean,"From the Sugarcane Agroindustry, we are committed to improve the responsible use of water and integrated watershed management and thus contribute to achieve by 2030 that the Pacific rivers in the area of influence of sugar reach their mouths, developing a management strategy by 2027 and thus reach a zero impact from the sugarcane sector on the water quality of the rivers in the area of influence. In this way, we will eliminate the furrow irrigation system by 2026 and thus achieve 85% of the area managed by sugarcane under a water balance approach by 2030.
Even though the carbon footprint of our sugar is one of the lowest in the world and we already contribute to avoid 4 million tons of carbon a year through the generation of electricity from sugarcane biomass, we pledge to further reduce our emissions to match our country's NDC commitments. Therefore, by 2030 we commit to reduce carbon emissions by more than 11%, as well as to reduce deforestation on sugarcane farms by 5% by 2024. We will also work together with our associates, so that by 2030 all the necessary actions are implemented to reduce the impacts on 100% of the critical flooding sites, and thus, operate private public systems for emergency response in the territories of influence of the sector. 
We will work on the care and protection of protected areas and in this sense, we will develop the recovery and protection of forests in an area equivalent to 10% of the area cultivated with sugar cane in the upper part of the basins or in mangrove areas as well as recover 400 kilometers of riverside forests in the Guatemalan Pacific area by 2030 and we are committed by 2027, a zero impact on the forests of the sugar cane area by the use of agrochemicals and crop burns.","From the private sector, we understand that there is a commitment and great efforts to achieve the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals to face the main global challenges, such as the fight against climate change and poverty reduction. Therefore, from ASAZGUA, we are committed to Sustainable Development and we promote the improvement of the quality of life through economic development, we use resources efficiently, we promote the circular economy, all this always from the search to improve environmental ecosystems, promoting clean technologies.
Therefore, we develop sustainability actions and practices that are being implemented to contribute with our country to achieve the goals proposed to reach an integral sustainable development, so we work in the environmental, social and economic dimensions.
Our sector is a key player in the development of the country and therefore our responsibility is also great. We understand our role as generators of opportunities and prosperity for millions of people in Guatemala, but we also assume the responsibility of doing so by generating decent employment, promoting development in the communities through social programs focused on education, health and municipal strengthening, through a self-management model that promotes empowerment and citizen participation of women, youth, teachers, health workers, community leaders and local authorities. 
We produce responsibly, taking advantage of and using natural resources in a sustainable manner, and to this end we have implemented concrete actions, such as precision agriculture techniques, use and development of technologies in our processes, water reuse, renewable energy generation, among others.
Therefore, our actions contribute and add to national and global efforts to meet the country goals of the Sustainable Development Goals of the 2030 Agenda, as well as the Climate Change and Biodiversity Agendas.
In addition to sugar as food, the Agroindustry works directly on water and energy issues as priority focuses and we ensure the implementation of concrete actions linked to other sustainable development objectives such as responsible production and consumption SDG 12, the end of poverty SDG1, the decent work SDG8, the end of hunger through the improvement of agricultural productivity and the improvement of the income of small producers and the improvement of the sustainability of production systems SDG2 , the reduction of inequalities SDG10, the care of biodiversity SDG15, fighting against climate change SDG13, education of quality SDG 4, the improvement of health services SDG3, and we seek for constant innovation and technologies SDG9 .","Private Institute for Climate Change Research (ICC),

It includes 11 sugar producers and four technical organizations specialized in:
CENGICAÑA started research activities to develop new varieties of sugarcane, to have integrated pest management, to study land quality and to implement more efficient processes for the cultivation of sugarcane and for the production of sugar. climate change
EXPOGRANEL, one of the most efficient boarding terminals for sugar export in the world, was launched to cover international markets in a more efficient and competitive manner.
In 2010, the Private Institute for Climate Change Research (ICC) was created to perform research, activities and projects related to climate change. 
FUNDAZUCAR was launched as the social branch for the development and implementation of programs and projects on health, education and development.
Currently, Guatemala is the third largest producer in Latin America and the fifth largest exporter of sugar in the world1. Sugar is the fourth most exported product in Guatemala. The Guatemala Sugar Agroindustry generates more than US $756 million in foreign exchange annually. 
ASAZGUA is committed to promote the implementation and fulfillment of the objectives and goals of the 2030 Agenda, as well as other global agendas, such as Climate Change, Biodiversity and Human Rights. For this reason, we work on actions directed in the three axes as the basis for achieving the sustainable development.
The Sugar Agroindustry has implemented practices to reduce water consumption and to ensure the rational use of this resource. 
Water consumption in agricultural processes has been reduced through the implementation of efficient irrigation systems as well as with the use of new innovative technologies and processes such as the dry cleaning of sugarcane which reduces substantially the use of vital liquids. 
The Sugar Cane Agroindustry, produces electricity for the operation of the sugar mills and covers at least 30% of the electricity demanded in the country, all this using 100% of the residual biomass (bagasse) obtained during sugar production, as well as decreasing the use of water and improving techniques that allow the production of green energy; to remain as an Agroindustry with zero net GHG emissions, 
The generation of renewable electricity from biomass has prevented 1.5 million tons of CO2 from reaching the environment by reducing the use of fossil fuels to generate energy. This neutralizes GHG emissions from sugar production.
The Guatemalan Sugarcane Industry is aware that responsible operations, a focus on a sustainability strategy and the circular economy, all together contribute to the value chain. Also committed to a sustainable production of sugar throughout a responsible use of water, energy production and research and development Our commitment is based in the national legal framework and Asazgua´s environmental policies.

3) Hydrogen production efforts within the Isfairam river basin region, by using the collected flood water and chain of the solar-wind-small hydropower stations. Isfairam river originates in the spurs of the Alai Range, with a peak of 5539 meters which works well for small hydropower stations.  The vortex - turbine, https://www.turbulent.be/, is an eco-friendly way to harness energy from rivers and canals, as a standalone or a cluster of turbines can be installed with a single turbine generation from 15 to 70 kW of electricity. The valley-foothill zone from 900 to 1200 meters above sea level, is characterized by hot summers, with temperatures 36-49°C, which should work well for solar panel stations. The windy valley areas along mountain peaks should work well for wind power stations. The electricity and water resources will be with reasonable expenses. Japanese Toshiba company already tested container-based Hydrogen production technologies  https://www.global.toshiba/ww/news/corporate/2015/04/pr2001.html for more than seven years. A similar approach can be set up for the pilot testing facilities along the Isfairam river with potential expansion on the bigger facilities. Hydrogen and Ammonia fertilizers will be produced and will be used directly by farmers.  Farmers will receive hydrogen energy for their engines, machines, tractors, and irrigation systems. The purified water will be released, as distilled water, from the engines. This output water needs to be enriched in the proper concentration of the right amount of fertilizers for the dedicated type of farmer crops, including quinoa, where Ammonia could be used, it could be developed in cooperation with Valmont Valley Irrigation Company, http://www.irrigation.education/","Our Osh region will be more sustainable against disasters, Emergency events (EE), and be stronger in climate change adaptation, related to flood - droughts issues. Rural communities will have the opportunity to get practical knowledge from experts, on how to mitigate  EE. 
Our initiative requires the proper TVET (technical and vocational education and training) capacity-building support to use these new sources of energy, and fertilizers for farmers. The balanced use of natural resources and sustainable use of mineral fertilizers, combined with eco-friendly technologies, including sustainable water usage, a responsible attitude to nature, and biodiversity, require proper knowledge, and advanced irrigation technologies with scientific and TVET support.
A practical college-based continuous education training facility for flood-drought mitigation, MAR, Hydrogen for Sustainable Agriculture application, and Quinoa drought-resistant crop production are necessary to set up. This initiative is in line with the 11 SDGS Goals, which are selected and shown above.

3) Hydrogen production efforts are expanding worldwide, including the implementation of the HYRASIA ONE project led by the European cleantech group SVEVIND Energy Group in Central Asia (CA). This project’s aim is to build one of the world’s largest industrial plants for the production of pure green hydrogen near the Caspian Sea with an investment of 50 Billion dollars. HYRASIA ONE is creating a wind-solar-hydrogen plant in CA that will produce up to 2 million tonnes of green hydrogen or 11 million tonnes of green ammonia per year, https://hyrasia.energy/, https://hyrasia.energy/2022/10/27/important-milestone-achieved-investme…,
https://invest.gov.kz/ru/media-center/press-releases/kazakhstan-obespec…
This HYRASIA ONE  project is identical to African Namibia  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75dXFyQ5m9Y, which is in development now. Ammonia is a pungent gas that is widely used to make agricultural fertilizers. Green ammonia production, the process of making ammonia, is 100% renewable and carbon-free. Globally, the fertilizer industry is responsible for about 1.1% of annual carbon emissions, due to using fossil energy as feedstock (approximately 80% of production uses natural gas, while coal accounts for approximately 15%). Green ammonia is currently the fertilizer industry’s best bet at reducing emissions.  As an alternative, we propose developing Hydrogen and Ammonia production in Osh Region within the Isfairam river basin region, using the collected flood water and chain of the solar-wind-small hydropower stations. Isfairam river originates in the spurs of the Alai Range, with a peak of 5539 meters which works well for small hydropower stations.

Initially negotiated as a regional instrument, it was opened up globally for accession to all UN Member States in 2016. Membership to the Water Convention is growing steadily, with six Parties from Africa having joined this global instrument in the period 2018–2022. More than 20 countries from various regions are in the process of accession. Numerous activities under the Convention are implemented worldwide, and over 130 countries take part in the Convention’s activities.
The Water Convention offers an institutional framework and many tools and mechanisms to support implementation. The Meeting of the Parties and the various working groups and task forces enable sharing experiences and implementing a jointly agreed programme of work. Through its various policy and technical tools, the Convention provides practical support to establishing, operationalizing and advancing cooperation.
For example, several recent Parties are supported in the development of plans to facilitate the implementation of the Water Convention’s requirements. The Water Convention and partners have supported the negotiations by Moldova and Ukraine on the Dniester Treaty signed in 2012. Following support provided by the Water Convention, the Convention for the Prevention of Conflicts Related to the Management of Shared Water Resources in Central Africa was adopted in 2020 by the Heads of State of the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) to strengthen regional cooperation on shared waters. The North Western Sahara Aquifer System (NWSAS) nexus assessment – prepared with the support of the Water Convention – helped Algeria, Libya and Tunisia jointly identify the benefits of improved water cooperation and develop a package of 15 high-priority solutions.
Objective:
The present commitment aims to ensure that through strengthened participation in and implementation of the Water Convention, a growing number of river and lake basins and transboundary aquifers worldwide are managed in cooperation between riparian countries in order to promote sustainable development and peace.
Focus areas:
The present commitment focuses on four key areas:
1. Support to Member States to increase awareness of and accession to the Water Convention, along with strengthening the capacity for implementation;
2. Support to the development and implementation of transboundary cooperation agreements and the establishment of joint bodies on the basis of the Water Convention, including support from the Water Convention Implementation Committee, where relevant;

The GYMW offers opportunities, capacity-building, a strong global network to rely on and a way to amplify their voices.

For more than 30 years, ISW has been acting as a catalyst for youth mobilization, connecting youth with other youth and decision-makers, and providing the technical & financial support youth need to be a force for change in this process. ISW aims to be the global youth center for water, with the support of the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC).
Over the last decade, youth water actors and respective networks have multiplied, at all levels, giving more and more volume to youth water engagement. However, youth advocacy, engagement groups and network associations in the water sector remain often fragmented, diminishing the collective voice and influence of young people. Therefore, at the last World Water Forum in Senegal in 2022, young people from all over the world participated in the first ‘Youth Space’ – a space created with the support of the SDC and under the leadership of the ISW and the Senegalese organizers. The ‘Youth Space’ provided the badly needed opportunity to enhance collaboration among themselves and to influence and catalyze necessary transformations. The output of this space at the 9th World Water Forum was the announcement and launch of the Global Youth Movement for Water, a coalition of youth organizations active in the water sector now chaired by the ISW with the support of the SDC and other partner organizations in the water sector, including but not limited to, the Global Water Partnership, Sanitation and Water for All, Stockholm International Water Institute, the Water & Climate Coalition, UN Water, and many more.
The Global Youth Movement for Water (GYMW) now brings together youth-led organizations and allies to which it provides visibility, credibility, and recognition. The GYMW is by youth, for youth and with youth and guided by an intergenerational approach, bringing together organizations that truly believe that you are agents of change. The GYMW currently consists of 250+ member organizations from 68 countries representing in total 110 000 young people mobilized around the world.
In the next 5 years, the International Secretariat for Water commits to catalyzing, coordinating and developing the Global Youth Movement for Water, with the collaboration of partner organizations in the water sector and the financial support of a coalition of financial partners, catalyzed by a confirmed financial commitment of the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation.","The aim of the Global Youth Movement for Water is to support, empower and connect youth networks and young people to (i) provide solutions for important water, environmental and societal challenges and to (ii) be recognized active, capable, reliable and credible stakeholders and change- makers in decision-making and policy shaping processes with the ultimate goal of creating a water-secure world for all.
More specifically, the GYMW works towards the following objectives:
- connect organizations active in the water & youth space to foster collaboration and synergies and increase the outreach and impact of all actors in this sector, from the local to the global levels.
- provide youth-led organizations with more visibility, credibility and recognition to existing and emerging networks and organizations as they engage and support individuals who wish to take action.
- enhance coordination and collaboration of local, regional and global water youth organizations through a community of practice;
- increase the financial and technical capacities of young water leaders.
For example, in preparation for the UN 2023 Water Conference, the Global Youth Movement aimed to mobilize and empower youth, to influence decision makers, to connect the local to the global and show that youth all over the world are mobilized and proposing concrete initiatives. With these objectives in mind and with the support of our partners, the International Secretariat for Water has:
-	Mobilized over 100000 young people through the coordination of the Global Youth Movement for Water.
-	Supported 18 youth-led regional events.
-	Financially supported 20 delegates to attend the conference.
-	Established a match-making process between young delegates and session organisers.
-	Launched a global youth-led communication campaign.
-	On the request of the UN, positioned the voices of youth in the opening & closing ceremonies.
-	Supported youth engagement and leadership in interactive dialogues, side events and three special events.
-	Supported the development of the advocacy messages and coordination mechanisms of young delegates.
For the next 5 years, ISW aims to continue supporting the Global Youth Movement for Water by:
-	Supporting the coordination of youth, and organisations supporting youth, especially young women.
-	Giving a voice to the unheard by creating spaces of intergenerational dialogues and influence, from the local to the global levels.
-	Offering training and capacity building to young people in the water sector.
-	Connecting youth in the water sector to other global issues such as climate, food security and migration.
-	Supporting youth innovation and local action.
Ultimately, the objective is to ensure that young people contribute to the effective implementation of the outcomes of the March 2023 conference (in particular the Water Action Agenda), make tangible changes during the rest of the International Decade for Action on Water for Sustainable Development, 2018-2028 and contribute to the achievement of SDG 6 of the Agenda 2030.","- Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC) is the official federal government agency responsible for Switzerland’s international cooperation and development activities. Switzerland has been instrumental in introducing the SDG 6 into the Agenda 2030.

The ambition of this Game Plan is to help governments achieve safely managed sanitation for their populations, and meet the sanitation target of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Under the Game Plan to Reach Safely Managed Sanitation, UNICEF will support 1 billion people to gain access to safely managed sanitation, through direct and indirect support, in collaboration with partners and under the leadership of government. As one of the most off-track SDGs, achieving the target for sanitation requires a quadrupling of progress. To meet this challenge, the game plan outlines a shift in UNICEF's ambition and programming approach. Aligned to the SDG 6 Accelerator Framework, it sets a course for greater systems strengthening within UNICEF programmes, aiming to create an enabling environment for rapid progress. It includes a compilation of the most essential government-led approaches and interventions, such as strengthening policy, improving sector coordination, securing appropriate finance, developing capacity at all levels and generating timely data for decision making. It calls for UNICEF to work with a wide range of partners, seeking collaboration, partnerships and alliances with other development partners, academics and private sector organizations with different and complementary capacities. It calls on UNICEF to think big and work at scale— supporting holistic, comprehensive solutions that transform the sector and create game-changing momentum through government- led policy and governance changes. It takes advantage of UNICEF’s presence in over 100 countries, including many fragile contexts. It embraces gender-responsive sanitation, encourage women’s leadership in the sanitation sector, and address the disproportionate impact of poor sanitation on women and girls. It mainstreams sanitation service delivery approaches that are climate-resilient, and considers sanitation as fundamental to both climate change adaptation and mitigation. The overarching objective is to fulfil UNICEF’s mandate to protect children's rights and to help meet their basic needs. It is designed to inspire UNICEF’s partners—to meet it in the shared ambition of safely managed sanitation for all.","The Sanitation Game Plan helps to dramatically improve partner support to countries by acting together in support of country priorities. The Game Plan is aligned to the SDG 6 Acceleration Framework which provides a valuable framework for achieving accelerated, coordinated progress on sanitation, and the Game Plan is aligned with them.
1. Governance: Make SDG 6 everyone’s business through cross-sector and transboundary collaboration, clear roles, stakeholder involvement, and effective and inclusive institutions.
2. Financing: Optimize financing for water and sanitation, particularly for countries and communities with limited access to financial resources.
3. Data and information: Build trust through data generation, validation, standardization and information exchange for decision- making, incentivization and accountability.
4. Capacity development: Focus on inclusive human and institutional capacities at all levels to deliver SDG 6.
5. Innovation: Leverage and scale up innovative practices, financing mechanisms and technologies, including technologies that are accessible for rural areas and marginalized communities.
Each accelerator is a ‘pillar’ within the Game Plan, with particular programming approaches related to each. The collaborative nature of the acceleration framework is reflected in the Game Plan as UNICEF action will rely on partnerships, collaboration and leveraging resources. The pillars are heavily interconnected and linked, and work under one may overlap with one or more others. Work on the accelerators must take place across multiple levels of government, including both national and local governments.
Possible implementation approaches and interventions for UNICEF are chosen in light of the country context, history of sanitation interventions, appropriate entry points, government priorities, country office capabilities, and the likelihood of success. The choice of implementation approach and priority interventions is based on a thorough understanding of the local context, including the levels of capacity and resources available, and UNICEF’s comparative advantage. Under the Game Plan, UNICEF will be open to a range of tools, methodologies and approaches, both those developed by UNICEF and by its partners.","Development agencies: WaterAid, Plan International, IRC, WSUP, and at the country level: local civil society organizations, including faith-based organizations, local NGOs and community-based organizations

- We will convey in the spaces where we participate at national and international level the need to recognise the global water crisis and to protect and manage water as a common good.
- The programmes we promote will seek to promote water governance based on human rights principles, especially the equal participation of women.
- We will work to ensure capacity building and institutional stability in the regions where we work, in order to achieve sustainability in the management of drinking water supply and sanitation systems in the most vulnerable contexts. Specifically, promoting and supporting community management practices.
- We will promote the use of accessible, disaggregated and public information systems that specifically include information on the most vulnerable groups, emphasising the need for information in relation to the different categories of the human right to water and sanitation.
- We will prioritise actions to achieve at least basic access to reach the most vulnerable and marginalised populations and areas, with special focus on sanitation and hygiene, including the management of the menstrual hygiene.
- We will carry out exhaustive monitoring of Spanish Official Development Assistance in the sector, in order to know precisely where and to whom the aid is destined and its social impact.
- We will demand, in alliance with other organisations, that the human rights to water and sanitation be respected and incorporated in other areas, beyond international aid, in Spain's external action, based on policy coherence.
An approach based on human rights is the conceptual framework which legitimizes our actions directed towards human development, as well as the instrument directing them in all phases.
We work for the realization and consecution of human rights and, in particular, the Human Right to water and sanitation, and we will achieve this from our sectorial specialization, through the provision of services, the strengthening of capacities, incidence, the improvement of public policies and the empowering of a critical and active civil society in all of the countries we are working in.
We are aware that the changes we pursue require partnering and bringing together common forces with other organizations. We partner with public and private entities who share our objectives and ethical criteria, and who we can count on through complementization when it comes to influencing governments and policies or for the development of the objectives we give ourselves.","The commitments made by ONGAWA aim to contribute to accelerate the implementation of SDG6 through actions to improve the public policies and interventions of Spanish Cooperation for Development, in partnership with other  organisations.

Le MFD abrite les têtes de source et les bassins supérieurs de 7 fleuves partagés par la quasi-totalité des pays de l’Afrique de l’Ouest, notamment la Gambie, le Niger et le Sénégal et un certain nombre de petits cours d'eau.
Le MFD constitue un immense réservoir de diversité biologique à protéger et à préserver, car il abrite de nombreuses espèces végétales et animales, dont certaines sont considérées comme endémiques et doivent faire l’objet d’une protection particulière. Le Massif recèle aussi d’importantes ressources minières.

o	Les coupes abusives de forêts pour satisfaire les besoins sans cesse croissants en bois de chauffe et en bois de service et la réduction du couvert végétal ; 
o	Les effets cumulés du changement climatique.

Aside from institutions and communities in the National Capital Region, MWF also serves communities beyond its service areas in Luzon, Visayas and in the Mindanao regions.",Philippines,Asia and Pacific,"Manila Water Foundation implements programs on water access, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) through a holistic and participatory approach. MWF, through its program teams ensure that the WASH interventions that it delivers with its valued partners considers the current context of the beneficiary to provide a tailor-fit WASH intervention. MWF’s WASH interventions may be from a broad range of infrastructure, advocacy campaign for health habits and education projects to ensure stakeholder impact.
In implementing its programs, MWF engages local government units and government institutions to fulfill shared objectives. This is an important step to maximize efforts and resources as well as ensure that the interventions are targeted and sustained.  MWF consults with community and institutional experts and follows the Program Design, Monitoring and Evaluation cycle to ensure that the WASH projects are truly responsive and relevant. 
Manila Water Foundation has three program houses. The Integrated WASH program of Manila Water Foundation delivers the full phases of water access and wastewater services in waterless and toilet less households and brings WASH programs to the community level and public spaces. The WASH Interventions program of Manila Water Foundation is a water access and sanitation infrastructure development program. Manila Water Foundation’s new program house, Environment, lends focus to the protection, conservation of natural resources and care for its surrounding communities.","Through thorough technical and social assessments, we can deeply understand the WASH needs of priority communities, allowing us to provide strategic support that can hasten the fulfillment of desired objectives. MWF also employs a screening methodology to determine the readiness and openness of the community to the needed WASH interventions, such as evaluation of tappable water resource, available sanitation services and the practice of proper hygiene habits. The community profiling also involves looking into the health status of the community and in doing so, the WASH intervention can be integrated with local healthcare programs, thereby utilizing available mechanisms that can hasten the fulfillment of the desired WASH objectives. 
By tapping on the expertise of various talents from the Manila Water Enterprise, MWF can provide employees with opportunities to take part in community work, at the same time harness technical knowledge that can be most useful to enable and equip community champions towards value-adding WASH activities.
As MWF now expands its network and visibility to a wider audience, it aims to attract like-minded organizations that can assemble towards a unified effort and activate shared equity. MWF encourages participation from the respective local government or institution, by resonating established polices and integrating government programs with the SDG 6 targets. This encourages local executives to champion the WASH interventions and summon the community towards a common goal.","Manila Water Foundation, as the social development arm of the Manila Water Company and its subsidiaries in the Philippines, forms synergies with a wide range of partners from both the private and public sectors.

Researchers estimate that the volume of untapped on-and offshore fresh groundwater is one hundred times greater than the amount extracted from the Earth's subsurface in the 20th century. Recent studies show that deep on-and offshore groundwater might be the most cost-effective and sustainable solution to water scarcity in many costal countries where these aquifers are connected to the surface and replenish continuously.  
To make unconventional sources of water accessible, innovative solutions from all angles need to be considered. Drawing on the successful case study of deep groundwater in Somalia, Ruden AS commits to promote inter-sectoral collaboration between the private sector (oil industry and water industry), academia and research on a global scale, and to assist the inter-ministerial dialogue through water-and-science diplomacy, laying water and science at the center of the discussion.","Achieving the SDGs by 2030 demands new strategies solutions and collaboration to tackle the complex problems. Deep, onshore, and offshore freshwater is an unconventional water resource with great potential, but it also poses great challenges. For example, to date, transboundary aquifers have been addressed only onshore. Outlined policies for offshore aquifers need to be developed. 
This action focuses on involving interdisciplinary expert parties (the private sector, research, and academia) in efforts to find solutions to complex problems, while working hand in hand with the Civil Society, International support, and Government entities. This action will delineate a way of working that facilitates communication, encourages innovation, and integrates teams that until now have been working in isolation from global efforts to achieve the SDG 6.","Government of Somalia: Ministry of Energy and Water Resources of Somalia (Leading and implementing ministry); Ministry of Petroleum and Mineral Resources of Somalia (supporting role); Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation of Somalia (supporting role).

            UN Water Conference 2023 - impacts of water supply in large urban centers",Peoples and countries in South America sharing transboundary waters (surface or underground),Brazil,Latin America and the Caribbean,". Research on water governance indicates that the participation of the groups involved is essential to democratize and expand the Sustainable Development Goals;
. Unfortunately, the foreign policies of countries lack greater social participation. Faced with this situation, it is necessary to expand the voices that act in the elaboration and implementation of foreign policy related to transboundary water, in particular, by guaranteeing the supply of quality water to the majority of the population.
. Getting to know the existing governance instruments is a first step towards increasing popular participation. In South America there are several international treaties on transboundary waters, however, they are not very effective given the inability to finance actions and the low institutionalization of the theme.
. The Water Geography Research Network brings together researchers from different parts of Brazil who study various aspects related to the supply of quality water in the country. In addition, several Graduate Programs at the University of São Paulo develop research projects related to topics such as transboundary waters; water governance in Brazil; fair distribution of water; water quality; among other topics.
. The expectation is to gather these initiatives through public events that can bring together people to advance in water governance by increasing the voices interested in the issue, in particular, by incorporating representatives of indigenous peoples and the local population, who are not called discussing foreign policy in South American countries.
. Another goal is to offer analyses of situations of cooperation and conflict over transboundary waters in South America to decision makers in governments of countries that share water. The situation on the Paraná River, for example, can be cited as a case in which both cooperation and conflict occurred, involving Brazil and Paraguay, related to the Itaipu Hydroelectric Power Plant. Analyzes can also be provided that discuss the Guarani aquifer, which has an international cooperation agreement between countries, but without popular participation in decision-making.","The expectation is to expand knowledge about the central themes of the UN 2023 Water Conference. Initially, through a debate on the objectives of the meeting, its main challenges, expressed in the four Interactive Dialogues. Actions related to the Water Action Agenda, which aims to provide quality water to more people through increased international cooperation, will also be discussed. To this end, it is essential to broaden the voices that work in water governance, especially from local communities and indigenous peoples, who are not usually called upon to give their opinion on these issues, especially when they are related to transboundary water, which involve external policies of countries. Often, the cooperation formats adopted favor certain segments of the population, which results in sources of tension within countries that can transcend borders and lead to tensions and conflicts between neighbors. It is also expected to produce syntheses that can be offered to decision makers in South American countries, part of the world that has important reserves of fresh water, both surface and groundwater. Despite this, there are tensions and conflicts that are caused by disputes over the use of water, such as those involving Brazil and Paraguay and, at another time, Argentina and Uruguay.
Such conflicts can be analyzed to prevent new tensions from arising and that cooperation can be established in a more symmetrical way, in order to contemplate the general interests of the population of the countries, considering the changes in the water supply that must occur in the face of climate change. The challenge is to guarantee the use of water without environmental injustice, and to provide quality water for different uses, without impacting other forms of life.
Maintaining ecosystem services and, at the same time, allowing the sustainable use of water is an important challenge to be faced, especially due to changes in rainfall, which affect water replacement. International cooperation on transboundary waters must be expanded beyond water sharing. It should also include analysis of future impacts that will affect freshwater stocks in the future. In short, it will be necessary to build a new political pact for the use of water in the world, through an International Convention on the subject. Situations of cooperation and sharing of water in South America can inspire agreements in other parts of the planet and provide subsidies for a necessary new global order of access to water in the 21st century.
It is expected to contribute to this debate through the proposed events, as well as with analytical syntheses of concrete situations, carried out through academic research.",Rede de Pesquisa de Geografia das Águas no Brasil - https://www.rede-geografia-das-aguas-no-brasil.com/,Goal 6,"6.1 , 6.4, 6.5, 6.a","Wed, 03/15/2023 - 12:00","Wed, 04/12/2023 - 12:00","On March 15, 2023, Professors Ana Lucia Britto (Federal University of Rio de Janeiro) and Wagner Costa Ribeiro (University of São Paulo),, who will be at the UN 2023 Water Conference, under the coordination of Professor Carlos Bordalo (Federal University of Pará), will discuss, in an event virtual, the main goals of the UN 2023 Water Conference.

The adoption of a political statement from the constituency of local and regional governments aims at bringing to light the importance of a renewed water governance, through calls from more than 323,000 sub-national institutions, from small municipalities to metropolises and regions. One of our objective is to remind that local authorities form a vital bridge between national governments, communities and citizens and will have a critical role in a new global partnership. 
Our constituency be present throughout the UN Water Conference, in particular through a local and regional governments day, to advocate for the fulfilment of the right to water, acknowledged by the United Nations as ""a fundamental right essential for the full enjoyment of the right to life and all human rights"". Still the right to water is not formally applied, particularly at local level. The scarcity and deterioration of water quality exacerbate inequalities of access.   very poorest people are the first to suffer. In many local and regional governments of least developed countries, women are the ones taking care and suffering from water distribution. In many countries of the South, the most vulnerable populations are subject to water shortages.
Our initiative aims at reminding that local and regional governments have been engaged in protecting their communities in such complex times, focusing on securing water supply and sanitation, avoiding water scarcity, protecting aquatic ecosystems, and fostering care systems.
City diplomacy and decentralised cooperation are the tools of local and regional government to continue to deliver essential water services to those who need it most. To ensure we leave nobody and no place behind and achieve SDG6, as well as all other SDGs we call, through our mobilization, for a more interconnected multilateral system based on multi-level governance and multi-stakeholder collaboration. Our organized constituency reinstates our commitment to the transformation of the multilateral system driven by the power of collective action, under our strategic input towards the SDGs Summit and Summit for the Future.
In regards to global water governance, our initiative calls on the international multilateral system to consider the many aspects of an urban world: rural and urban territories, small and intermediate cities, metropolitan entities, and regions. It must also provide financial support and capacity building for local and regional governments (LRGs) to engage in this process. An approach across government and society for addressing inequality, climate change and biodiversity, and for fostering peace is equally critical to changing our systems. The renewed multilateral system will also need to consider water and conflicts where water is being used as a weapon, war crimes or crimes against humanity related to water resources.","The commitments underlined in this initiative are made to ensure an accelerated implementation of SDG 6, ensuring all targets are met, and for a renewed governance that closes the gap through the localization of this and all water-related SDGs.
Our constituency of local and regional governments calls for a stronger consideration of water as a human right, including access to safe and affordable drinking water and sanitation for all to encourage ongoing support from all spheres of government to ensure access to water and sanitation services for all so as to meet targets 6.1 and 6.2.
Regarding sustainable management, we call to strengthen the capacities of local and regional governments in building sustainable management models, protecting water as a public good, and developing an integrated and comprehensive approach to water management at all levels,  including water efficiency-related topics such as solid waste management, agriculture, and environmental health to reach target 6.4. It is also essential to acknowledge the crucial role of multi-level governance and multi-stakeholder collaboration when it comes to protecting our ecosystem, as well as the promotion of sustainable and responsible use of water
Our constituency calls on national governments and the international system to contribute to the development of an enabling environment for local and regional governments to implement, run and regulate water efficiently, and user-centered essential services, such as safe water production and supply, wastewater management, and solid waste management, and for their involvement in any decisions related to improving water management so as to reach target 6.3 by 2030.
This document will address the importance of strengthening local public service provision and the right to water, as well as the protection of water ecosystems, including mountains forests, wetlands  and biodiversity, thus addressing target 6.6 directly.
A renewed international and multilateral system is the way for more equitable governance of water, we call on the involvement of intermediary cities, small towns, and rural areas and territories in the achievement of SDG6 and the universal development agendas. This means ensuring women and girls’ inclusion in water management, and including them in positions of responsibility, and promoting participatory, inclusive approaches that ensure all voices are accounted for and represented in decision-making, enabling us to reach targets 6.5 and 6.B
To ensure that goal 6 is achieved, it is critical to renew the financial structure and different involvement of the private sector. We call on development banks and central banks to provide direct access to financing for ""Climate-Biodiversity"" projects of cities, and to allow bidding in all official languages of the United Nations.  We aim at encouraging innovative financial solidarity mechanisms at local level, and rethink fiscal architecture, strengthen local finance to provide sufficient financial capacity to reach the SDG targets. It will be critical to establishing instruments - at the national and multilateral levels - to finance water savings and expand international cooperation and capacity building to support those governments that are further away, allowing us to meet target 6.A","ICLEI - Local Governments for Sustainability

As part of its Strategic Framework for 2022-2031, it has launched a new initiative on Addressing Water Scarcity in Agriculture and the environment (AWSAMe) with the ambition to develop a global programme on water scarcity that will enhance the resilience of countries to climate change in order to achieve food security, nutrition and a better environment. AWSAMe is currently in its inception phase, promoting drought resilient and nutritious crops to cope with water scarcity and will work with partners such as CIRAD, ICARDA, ICBA and ICRISAT to support countries with evidence based practices that will enhance countries resilience to climate change with regards to agriculture production, food security and nutrition as well as the protection of biodiversity. 
FAO also hosts the Global Framework on Water Scarcity in Agriculture (WASAG) which brings all Member countries and knowledge partners who actively work on collaborative and innovative solutions to water scarcity in agriculture. The WASAG is open to all countries and its Partners include:   
 United Nations agencies 
 intergovernmental organizations  
 Academia and Research institutions 
Civil society organizations, including Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) 
Private sector organizations and trade associations. 
WASAG Partners collaborate works through different working groups to address topics such as drought preparedness, financing mechanisms, saline agriculture, sustainable agriculture water use, water and migration and water and nutrition. As, these working groups are community of practice where they collaborate to develop knowledge products that will assist countries. 
 WASAG is already registered as an Agenda 30 Partnership Accelerator on the UNDESA website.   
Several countries support the work of WASAG in different ways.  They include Cabo Verde, Canada (through Quebec), Switzerland and Italy. Cabo Verde has hosted the WASAG International Forum of WASAG twice, in March 2019 and in February 2023. These forums adopted The Praia Declaration (March 2019) and The Praia Call for Action (February 2023). These are commitments reflecting the resolve of the Partners to find solutions and translate them into practical actions on the ground.  
Further, the Praia Declaration goes one step forward by inviting all Member countries to become Partners of WASAG, under the expressed leadership, as a start, of the Prime Minister of Cabo Verde as the first Chairperson of the new WASAG Partnership consisting of all Member Countries and Partners under this revised governance model. 
WASAG has four key actions, in addition to the working groups, as delivery mechanisms, as reflected in   its Strategy for 2021-2024: (1) Development of initiatives to address water scarcity; (2) Innovation and data; (3) Research and training and (4) Awareness raising. 
These key action areas are at different levels of implementation, driven by demand, opportunities and available resources.",The  work of WASAG Partners  through the working groups and their activities combined with the convening power of  FAO and its own work on water scarcity have created a synergy of good will and a spirit of commitment with results in a collaboration that accelerates the implementation of the SDGs because the collaboration avoid duplication and strengthens linkages.,"The Government of Cabo Verde as a key partner in this commitment.

            Through our extensive research on India’s urban water and climate security, we have been able to identify common gaps, challenges and opportunities in a policy brief for urban governance mechanisms to respond to the rising water and climate challenges.",We commit to building and strengthening South Asian regional and intersectional relations ; water security for all with justice and equity at its core in urban water governance.,India,Asia and Pacific,"Our focus is to build results oriented integrated frameworks to ensure water security for all (includes equitable access to the resource, management and water supply; good quality of water for drinking, domestic and other livelihood purposes; sanitation and hygiene; access to information and data; full & meaningful participation in decision-making of water governance; accountability and transparency of urban local bodies). Our core focus is to ensure that the voices of women and young girls, migrant and marginalized communities who are disproportionately affected by water stress are included in decision-making. Our framework, through gender integration, steers clear  pathways for intersectional approaches to water security. 
We further aim to mainstream water security into urban planning and governance for a truly sustainable economy & ecology in the future. Water is at the heart of the climate crisis. We believe that economic planning without integrating water security is indispensable in the age of anthropocene and climate crisis. More discussions involving strong participation and perspectives from multiple stakeholders. Facilitate collaborations, learning of good practices within the systems globally, regionally & locally. 
With justice and equity at the center of focus, we propose designing principles and leveraging inclusive collaboration with water as a reinforcing cross-sector for achieving SDG 6, climate resilience and adaptation, and sustainable economy. A combination of innovative short-term goals and comprehensive long term goals along with strengthening institutional and individual capacity will create integrated and transformative approaches towards water hazards & stress related challenges.","South Asia is a water stressed region, and has many shared transboundary water and other natural resources. Through regional cooperation, water has great potential to build peace and generate cross-country resource sharing platforms in this region. Water related goals can only be attained with high-level political awareness and transformative action on the ground. The forum at the UN Water Conference promises to enable this process and bridge gaps by bringing all stakeholders in one room.
In order to develop a more comprehensive approach to our ideas, we collaborate with subject matter experts to look at various aspects of water, climate and gender. We can facilitate and mobilize gender responsive water resource management frameworks for transboundary cooperation and water resilience in South Asia.

            Identifying progress in the implementation of sustainable lake management at UNEA6",Lake basin stakeholders and all who benefit from lakes and lentic waters,"Australia, Brazil, Estonia, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Japan, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Nepal, Philippines, United States of America",Global,"Even though lakes account for more than 90% of the freshwater resources (liquid) on the earth, their importance has not been reflected adequately in the ""Global Water Agenda"" and the ""Sustainable Development Goals."" (SDGs).  Meanwhile, a resolution on “Sustainable Lake management” adopted by the 5th United Nations Environment Conference (UNEA5) in March 2022 is expected to be instrumental in mainstreaming lakes in those and other global commitments.
The International Lake Environment Committee Foundation (ILEC) has undertaken a wide range of activities to contribute to the sustainable management and conservation of the world’s lakes and their basins since its establishment in 1986.
ILEC has taken the lead in implementing international research and capacity-building activities for the sustainable management and conservation of the lakes and their basins. ILEC has organized the World Lake Conference (WLC) regularly with host organizations around the world since 1986. It is a unique international conference focusing on the science policy and governance interfaces, with broad public participation to address lake-related issues at the individual-lake, local, national, regional, and global levels.
In addition, ILEC’s “Scientific Committee,” consisting of scientists and experts from around the world, has played an instrumental role in assessing the current status of lake basin management globally.  With their efforts, ILEC was able to play a lead role in strengthening the science-policy-governance interfaces in lake basin management, particularly through developing and promoting the concept of Integrated Lake Basin Management (ILBM) and undertaking applied study and dissemination activities, for which the WLC also played a significant role.
ILEC has also conducted a wide range of training programs for mid-carrier government officials, members from research institutions, and non-governmental organizations from around the world. Through implementing training programs, ILEC contributes to improving the governance of lake basin management in developing countries to address the ILBM Framework.　To date, the ILEC has received 562 participants from 71 countries.
In the fields mentioned above, ILEC wishes continue to contribute, in collaboration with other national and international governments and organizations, to the global efforts in sustainable lake basin management by playing a global hub for knowledge-sharing and cross-fertilization of experience and lessons learned at the local, national, and regional levels.
The 19th World Lake Conference (WLC19) in Hungary in November 2023, UNEA6 in Nairobi in February-March 2024, and the 10th World Water Forum in Indonesia in March 2024 will be our significant milestones toward gaining momentum in the implementation of sustainable lake management activities. Moreover, ILEC wishes to take the lead in recognizing World Lake Day as a symbolic action to raise awareness of lakes’ vital role at all levels.","ILEC's long-standing integrated lake basin management (ILBM) training program is in increasing demand each year. The training enables participants to expand their global network, share knowledge and experience, and contribute to capacity building in sustainable lake management in each region in cooperation with ILEC Scientific Committee members active worldwide.
ILEC expects that the global framework on water will emphasize lakes and clearly distinguish between the hydrostatic-hydrodynamic state of water versus the lentic-lotic state of water. This distinction should lead to a much broader and more profound approach to the sustainability of global freshwater far beyond SDG. IWRM and IRBM will be more focused on the ILBM concept because ILBM that has taken into account lake features (long retention time, complex interactions within the lake, and integration of natural and human activities) needs to include pieces in these concepts.
Furthermore, the establishment of World Lakes Day will provide more opportunities for various stakeholder groups to recognize the value of lakes and to promote their activities. As bottom-up approaches and residents’ ownership of lakes gradually advance and expand worldwide, sustainable lake management will be realized in which the basin residents play a proactive role rather than being left to only the government.",UNEP・Southeast Asian Limnological Network・Wetlands International South Asia・Institute Corazon de la Tierra ・Living Lakes ・Shiga Prefectural Government,"Goal 6, Goal 13, Goal 15, Goal 17","6.3, 6.5, 6.6, 6.b , 17.9, 17.14, 17.16, 17.17",,,"Mainstreaming Lakes and other lentic waters more prominently in the Global Water Agenda

Academia",Australia,Global,"Addressing the global water challenges means addressing the health and resilience of the world's rivers. There cannot be sustainable development without healthy rivers. Rivers are the lifeblood of the land, people, and economies they support. Rivers are the most degraded ecosystems in the world; if a river stops flowing, life stops working. 
For more than 20 years, the International RiverFoundation (IRF) has shone a spotlight on the global agenda for rivers. Our vision is a world of thriving and resilient rivers for future generations. We endeavour to achieve this through the four pillars of collaborating, convening, communicating, and celebrating these important ecosystems. We promote the protection, sustainable development and restoration of rivers across borders through facilitating system understanding, effective governance, adaptive and transformational actions, and innovative funding.
Through COLLABORATION, the IRF will build strong and lasting partnerships with key organisations to develop, facilitate, and implement a framework for thriving and resilient rivers through the Resilience Rivers Blueprint and Hub. We continue to CONVENE global river leaders and stakeholders through the International Riversymposium (25 years) and regular forums and think tanks. Through Voices for Rivers, we COMMUNICATE and amplify the critical role of rivers in sustaining life on this planet and bring key and necessary actions to protect and restore them to the forefront of the global water agenda. The International and Regional River Prizes CELEBRATE, recognise and financially support the work of those implementing on-the-ground actions to achieve thriving and resilient rivers. 
With the accelerating impacts of climate change and biodiversity loss, now more than ever, we need effective partnerships and a coordinated approach to enable groundbreaking action for rivers.","This new action will provide a more tangible link between SDG6 and SDG17 to address the Global Water Challenge. In partnership with governments, private sector and communities through shared goals, this action will accelerate SDG implementation through the following areas of commitments for our rivers: governance; monitoring and information; protection and restoration of freshwater ecosystems; innovative financing;  and celebrating and valuing success. 
To achieve our vision of thriving and resilient rivers through our four pillars of Collaborating, Convening, Communicating and Celebrating rivers, we are able to accelerate implementation of SDG6, specifically access to clean drinking water (6.1), providing sanitation to communities (6.2), reducing pollution to our rivers (6.3), enhancing water efficiency (6.4), embedding climate resilience in integrated water resource management (6.5), and promoting capacity building and knowledge exchange through Riversymposiums and forums (6.a). These combined actions can only be achieved through cross-sectoral partnerships (6.b), helping to protect and restore water-related ecosystems (6.6). 
We recognise that river challenges have no borders. Therefore, we rely on strong partnerships and our broader networks (SDG17) of government, corporates, science and community networks to achieve our vision.","Brisbane City Council

These Fields and Arrays will be located on the islands of Ebadon, Enelabkan (Carlos), Enebouj (Carlson), Ebejedrik, Bikej and Enubirr (Santo) within the Kwajalein Atoll. Water will be sold to the Kwajalein Atoll Development Authority through a Water Purchase Agreement (WPA), providing reliable, clean drinking water to the communities on the island. Each SOURCE Field or SOURCE Hydropanel Array is designed with remote monitoring capabilities to allow for continuous optimization and maximizing of production. SOURCE Fields and Arrays will both have a direct dispensing point where people in the community can fill up water using reusable cans/bottles, eliminating the need to transport bottled water to the islands via boat and the waste and contamination associated with single-use plastic water bottles.","The Marshall Islands Kwajalein Atoll Water Project will serve the 171 households across the six islands that have struggled with water access and security. In addition to providing the human basic need for drinking water, we are addressing the linkages of equitable access, health, and economics. This investment in climate-resilient water services shows a commitment by local and international governments to provide for remote and rural populations. Estimates by Vivid Economics show that universal access to safely managed water supplies could prevent up to 6 billion cases of diarrhea and 12 billion cases of parasites between 2021-2040, and save $36-37 billion per year in global health care costs -- a return of 21 times the initial cost of implementing safe water systems. SOURCE Hydropanels were designed to be scaled to meet the drinking water needs of any location - from a single home to an entire community. The systems can be expanded to larger “farms” of interconnected Hydropanels to generate large volumes of water for community supply and larger-scale resilience and storage, along with consumption models that include ATM-style and circular distribution models to serve larger communities. Similar to power purchase agreements, Hydropanel arrays can also be contracted in an innovative financing vehicle called a “Water Purchase Agreement” or “WPA”. WPAs charge customers a fixed price per liter that is generated over the length of a 5-15 year contract. Hydropanel arrays are sized to meet the volume needed and built, operated, and maintained by Source at no cost to the customer. Importantly, a single WPA can deploy technology across a large area of low-density population - for example, a single WPA can provide household drinking water to 10 islands, 100 villages or 1,000 schools at the point of consumption, which makes it dramatically cheaper than the extension of traditional centralized infrastructure. The potential of this model is access and scale - a regional financing opportunity to rapidly enable long term, resilient access to drinking water to households in the same way that renewable microgrids have done so for electricity access and cell phone towers have done so for information access.",Kwajalein Atoll Development Authority,Goal 6,"6.1 , 6.a, 6.b","Mon, 03/20/2023 - 12:00","Thu, 02/15/2024 - 12:00",,0.375,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

Communities in the Pacific Northwest of North America","Canada, United States of America",North America,"NAYPW brings together youth and young professionals to develop sustainable solutions for water issues in North America based on the United Nations’ SDG 6. The “Youth for the Future of the Columbia River Basin” represents the commitment of young people in the Columbia River Basin following the NAYPW Youth Forums for the Columbia River . The Forums on 11 February, 2022, was an effort to bring awareness to the youth voices of the Columbia River Basin in this closing window of opportunity to be heard by Columbia River Treaty negotiators.
The objectives of the Vision effort are to: gather youth from across the transboundary Columbia River Basin; mobilize and educate youth on issues facing the Columbia River Basin; empower youth with knowledge on action opportunities and potential partners; collate concerns and visions for the future of youth in the Basin; and promote concerns and commitments to action in final years of the Columbia River Treaty negotiations and future of the Columbia River Basin.
Our target audience for the project is youth and young professionals in the Columbia River Basin (ages 16-35 years old), as well as additional community leaders and experts to facilitate intergenerational knowledge transfer and listening across the basin geography and generations. The final output report, “Youth Vision and Actions for the Future of the Columbia River,” will be a tool to communicate the concerns of youth in the basin to decision-makers and negotiators in the basin.","SDG 6 “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all” is supported in this commitment through the integration of youth and young professionals in the Columbia River Basin into more long-term water management planning. Target 6.b calls for strengthened community participation in water management. Youth and young people represent the present and future of their communities. This commitment and effort brings youth, and therefore their communities and futures, into greater engagement with the Columbia River Basin management system through education and mobilization. Additionally, as youth and young people from this effort have a unique focus on ecosystem protections, Target 6.6 to protect and restore water-related ecosystems will also be supported through this commitment. The consistent pressure of youth presence in this basin will encourage current and future policy makers to focus on this ecosystem protection goals. 
Goal 13 for climate change, Target 13.2 will be supported by this commitment to youth engagement in the Columbia River Basin. Youth know that the current hydroelectric infrastructure in the basin is not climate-resilient and have specific expectations and ideas to address this issue. Increased youth engagement and inclusion in Columbia River governance processes will embed greater climate change adaptive measures into the future of Columbia River basin management policies in the USA and Canada. 
Goal 15 Targets 15.5 and 15.6 are enhanced by youth engagement in the Columbia River Basin. Youth are aware of the past of the Columbia River defined by aquatic species loss, particularly of salmonid populations of cultural and spiritual importance to the Indigenous communities in the region.

DKK for ""Piloting the Nexus Approach in Water & Resilience interventions in Burkina Faso (NAWAR)"". The project implementation phase will run from April 2023 to March 2026 (36 months – 3 years) and will target the Centre-Nord region of Burkina Faso. This project aims to pilot a model for humanitarian-development-peace (HDP) nexus investments in Burkina Faso focused on sustainable access to water for agricultural use and sustainable food security. The project will build on WFP’s integrated resilience approach and expand it to encompass other aspects of the HDP-nexus. It will combine WFP’s expertise in the field of resilience with Denmark’s expertise on water management.
This project is a pilot of an integrated water approach in the semi-arid regions of Burkina Faso. The aim is to intervene around the water resource in a joint manner (access to the resource, management of the resource, sustainability of the resource, considering its use for both production and human utilisation), with the aim of optimizing its performance at all levels (HH, communities, agriculture, income generation, etc.). The use of green energy such as solar energy allows to ensure sustainability of the intervention by ensuring a reduced ecological impact and fits in the strategy of future development of the WFP intervention around energy for food.
WFP’s approach aims at reducing vulnerabilities and tackling root causes of fragility through asset creation and livelihoods activities, while ensuring improved access to and better use of natural resources and social services. Further, capacity strengthening of institutions and local actors enhances governance to deliver quality programmes and equitable services.
The project aims to address many of the basic humanitarian needs in a sustainable manner, while at the same time boosting long-term development and stabilization for selected communities, in line with the HDP-nexus approach.
The project will consist of three main phases:
1)	Transfer of know-how and feasibility studies: “Finding and extracting water”.
2)	Installation of hardware: “Making water available to end users (infrastructure sizing and construction, management and maintenance of infrastructures etc.)”.
3)	Bringing hardware to life: “Impact and governance of water being available to the communities – for both private consumption and production”.","This project will contribute to scaling-up WFP’s resilience activities on clean water and irrigation. WFP’s participatory planning processes are central to the efforts, fostering dialogue and trust at community level and to the extent possible, leveraging on the leadership of decentralised authorities.
The project aligns with a vision of sustainable development. Production processes and economic development are often associated with an increased environmental footprint. This project utilises clean technologies minimising adverse environmental impacts. While the infrastructure component foresees green technologies based on renewable energies, the economic development component will support green jobs, and the dissemination of green technologies.
Green infrastructure. This project uses solar-powered water pumps to generate power for drinking and irrigation of school and market gardens, thereby reducing the possible carbon footprint compared to diesel water pumps regularly used. The total greenhouse gas emissions avoided by using solar pumps are estimated to be 27.6 ton of CO2 per year
Green growth and sustainable practices. The project envisages a number of activities at community and household levels, introducing sustainable practices of production and behavioural change. These practices aim at the general environmental footprint of the project on vegetable production sites, as well as an improvement of the village ecosystem. These activities include:
-	Large-scale composting for vegetable gardens (replacing mineral/chemical fertilizer)
-	Production and planting of a minimum of 50,000 trees through the project serving as windshields and barriers (capturing carbon, improving micro-climate)",World Food Programme (WFP),"Goal 2, Goal 6, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 15","2.1 , 2.4 , 6.1 , 6.4, 6.b , 12.2, 12.a, 13.1, 13.a, 15.1, 15.3",,,,0.375,0.4444444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05494505494505515

Youth are the future water managers of the diverse communities that need these interventions and infrastructure projects. Job training and employer market openness to the coming wave of water managers will help ensure that today’s water projects are managed for our future. To ensure that these projects benefit communities across North America and benefit from the support of nearby communities, industries should also actively seek that their future water managers look like the communities they are supporting. Future efforts for water projects should focus on delivering multifaceted benefits that  meet the needs of diverse interest groups and local communities. Gone should be the days when only a limited number or type of experts are consulted when planning water development projects. In North America, we have experience with how short-sighted such an approach is.
The objective of this initiative is to provide training, develop networks and enhance the ability of youth and young professionals to receive job training and enter the job market with the required skills to succeed in developing water infrastructure necessary to solve the pressing water issues of the 21st century. This initiative will be implemented with virtual workshops and training sessions by water experts and professionals for youth 18-35 years of age. It will also include on-the-ground, in-person networking sessions and field tours to allow youth to learn about the work done by local industries to solve water issues and develop infrastructure. This will also include working directly with organizations to develop positions available only for youth as seen with the youth position developed by the NAYPW on the Board of Directors for the Benton Soil and Water Conservation District.","This action will accelerate the implementation of SDG 5 - Gender Equality, SDG 6 - Clean Water and Sanitation, and SDG 8 - Decent Work and Economic Growth. Target 5.5 is to ensure women’s full and effective participation and equal opportunities for leadership at all levels of decision-making in political, economic and public life. This program will particularly target the role that women  play as water caretakers, and through targeted outreach and the inclusion of women-led sessions, training opportunities and women-identifying experts, will ensure the full participation of women-identifying youth and young professionals. It will also promote the inclusion of women within the water industry.
Target 8.6 states that by 2020 the proportion of youth not in employment, education or training will be substantially reduced. While this target was to be achieved by 2020, this program will continue to accelerate and reduce barriers to youth employment, education or training as it relates to the water industry. The different opportunities within the program will provide youth with the opportunity to gain experience in water industries and thereby reduce the likelihood of future unemployment. It will also increase their education and training opportunities.
Target 6.B supports and strengthens the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management. As well, target 6.5 focuses on the implementation of integrated water resources management (IWRM) at all levels. IWRM specifically looks at the inclusion of all individuals in a watershed or basin; this includes youth and young professionals. This program will help implement IWRM by developing positions specifically for youth and young professionals to engage in water decision-making opportunities within organizations.

Youth acquire deeper understanding and connection with nature/biodiversity and it will inspire them to be advocates and become champions of change for conservation. IWF partners with global organizations that promote adaptation and conservation through people- centred approaches.
We will explore approaches like ecosystem based adaptation because, EBA provides many other benefits to communities, for example through the maintenance and enhancement of ecosystem services crucial for livelihoods and human well-being, such as clean water, water regulation and habitat, recreational opportunities and food. Furthermore, ecosystem-based approaches often provide employment opportunities. Appropriately designed ecosystem management initiatives can also contribute to climate change mitigation, for example, by reducing emissions from ecosystem loss and degradation.
With water and climate interlinkage education communities are encouraged to use this information to take action in their daily lives. We aid them to be advocates of watershed protection in their communities. It is critical to equally engage young people and women,  the schools and the communities as stakeholders in preserving the ecosystem, development and sustainability as they are catalysts for awareness. This is a significant step to Water Action and establish an all inclusive key players in the society. Climate change manifests itself primarily through changes in the water cycle. As climate changes, droughts, floods, melting glaciers, sea-level rise and storms intensify or alter, often with severe consequences. Climate change impacts have direct consequences for water security and conflict. In order to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, climate change adaptation will have to build climate resilience. Climate resilience is strengthened through healthy ecosystem services that rely on well-functioning river basins. Effective community-driven climate change adaptation should reflect the importance of water management in reducing vulnerability and building climate resilience. Conduct public awareness campaigns on sustainable water management targeting schools, communities, agriculture and business, mainstreaming the link with the environment and climate change. Empower communities to develop conflict-sensitive water management, e.g. helping flood-prone communities to adapt to climate change. Build environmental and climate resilience skills with professional associations, partnerships, universities, like minded NGOs and also government agencies.. Generate knowledge, for example on water-related risks and ecosystem services, by promoting local research & innovation on climate and environmentally sustainable water management.","We believe that through our action of a community-based approach to the implementation of Water security and climate interlinkage initiative we can work together to help accelerate SDG implementation. By integrating water management and community-led solutions on a village and community level, we can influence government leaders with their plans and policies: We would be advocating for the incorporation of water-related issues into the development planning of communities, districts, and countries can ensure that water resources are sustainably managed and used to promote economic growth, social development, and environmental sustainability. Our initiatives will directly Improve access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene: By improving access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene, countries can improve health outcomes, reduce poverty, increase economic productivity, and promote gender equality. Our initiatives will also be educational with our on-the-ground partners to enhance water-use efficiency: By promoting water-use efficiency in agriculture, industry, and households, communities can reduce water scarcity, increase food security, and promote sustainable economic growth. Lastly, as we work alongside villages and communities, we will be protecting and restoring water ecosystems: By protecting and restoring water ecosystems, communities can preserve biodiversity, mitigate climate change, and improve water quality. We will encourage anticipatory action and locally led adaptation by integrating anticipatory action with longer term actions aimed at improving the climate resilience of communities with a user-centered approach. We will ensure cross fertilization of learning and efficient knowledge management.
This initiative aims to enable different actors at global, national and local level to more effectively manage water-related risks. This strategy has been developed recognizing that the current climate change and water crisis in Africa are inextricably linked and require systemic changes. This intervention plans to drive that change using an integrated climate and water approach to deal with increasing exposure to water related risks. The amplification of the impact of this action is guided by its mission to holistically equip the communities, youth, and  women. To create champions of change  with ample knowledge of resource  and good practice examples so then they can advocate for environment protection as well as practice sustainable living that doesn't harm the planet and promote health and development. It has to be highlighted that ‘the ones left behind’ such as vulnerable communities are prioritized. The human-centred approach in planning and implementation shall encourage resilience through knowledge transfer in their local context. Added impact and benefits in terms of development program is ensuring alignment with SDG 6 throughout its implementation. Since the program is facilitated for communities, basic rights of women are ensured through provision of safe water to drink, menstrual hygiene management and sanitation facilities are in focus. The connect have to made for the communities on environment, ecosystem protection, climate change and water security  among others and this will assure in many other future work shared goals are expanded and reproduced to more communities where different actors in the society are able to listen to each other, build connections and trust to act upon attaining our human goals.","Ministry of science and technology, Ministry of rural development, Ministry of Jalshakti, Ministry of Environment forest and climate change, , sub national governments of selected districts, UNEP, UN ECSAP etc. Ministries from other countries, academia, media and liaising with various regional and thematic development partners.

A key objective of the platform will be to position water issues at the forefront of global sustainability agendas and processes. The solution-oriented scientific assessment, implemented by national entities based on each Member State’s particular vulnerabilities will be carried out regularly, with continuous updates developed in close coordination with relevant UN agencies and other intergovernmental mechanisms. By creating an internationally validated framework for member countries’ benefit, using the principles of solidarity, sustainability and science, a global science assessment can be undertaken, integrating existing data to design a sustainability framework that can be scaled down to regional, national and river basin levels. The framework would offer thematic and/or regional practical actionable solutions for policy, regulation, and decision-making. It would identify capacity development, implementation, financing opportunities and infrastructure needs in two ways: • Scientific underpinning of solution-oriented assessments for evidence-based action, compiling harmonized data and knowledge sources. • Developing a new relationship between science and policymaking, by establishing intergovernmental validation mechanisms, analogous to IPCC and IPBES conventions. ISPWAS would constitute a collaborative effort from UN member countries and international organisations, which agree that the combined effort is greater than the sum of their contributions. Buy-in support from Member States means that existing data, analyses, technology, reporting mechanisms, etc. –currently fragmented – can be pooled and combined with indigenous and local sources of knowledge and on-ground observations through citizen science, to develop thematic or geographic assessments of systemic water challenges. Integrating cross-sectoral information across spatial and temporal scales will reveal emerging solutions that are invisible in the currently existing disjointed kaleidoscope of assessments, programs, and policies. ISPWAS will identify state-of-the-art solutions, based on science, research, engineering, technology, and innovations. It will bring together funding opportunities, data, tools, assessments, and programs, and will provide validation, support, and capacity development, by engaging with multiple stakeholders (including indigenous peoples, local water user representatives and citizens). In order to achieve cross-sectoral integration, synergies will be sought between intergovernmental mechanisms such as IPBES, which may offer learnings on how to integrate complex assessments. Other function is the development of comprehensive science-based assessments of supporting data, tools and mechanisms, and validation and verification mechanisms through transparent triangulation and peer-review processes. ISPWAS would facilitate a Dialogue Forum to discuss sustainable solutions. It would provide a number of products such as evidence-based solutions, assessment of impacts, and regular communication outputs, to support solutions in two dimensions: (i) for Member States, at various spatial scales, promoting regional cooperation and water diplomacy, and (ii) for cross-sectoral solutions to achieve internationally agreed targets for SDGs, climate change and biodiversity objectives. This may include frequent updates on water balances, supply and demand.","A global water assessment will be able to identify low-cost nature-based solutions, which incorporate principles of availability, accessibility, quality, stability, relevance, ownership, and amplify boundary scale impacts emerging from the interaction of large to local scale management actions. It will have the ability to analyse complexities and interdependencies, fragmentation, and scale issues, and provide forecasts and scenarios, cost-benefit analysis tools and case studies, capacity development and crisis response options. In doing so, it will strengthen horizontal and vertical science-policy engagement and provide a global mechanism for water-related policymaking. The Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform for Water Sustainability will: ● facilitate a synthesis and assessment process of the scientific community that would offer a high level of legitimacy and authority, with the aim of co-designing knowledge transfer between science and policy. ISPWAS will avoid recycling from other sources but offer unique value-added products implemented by Member States’ own national authorities and validated by an intergovernmental mechanism, bridging the science-policy gap that hinders sustainable water management. ● provide up-to-date assessments with tools, processes and models, addressing the up-to-date needs of policy and decision-makers, focusing on the interaction between global anthropogenic activities and water resource availability. It will focus on solution-oriented assessment, scenarios and forecasting models, considering the inter-sectoral, systemic, integrative, and transdisciplinary nature of the complex and interconnected water challenges. ● provide an opportunity to disrupt significant drivers of the water system degradation and influence the decision domain by providing the necessary information on the evidence- and multicriteria-based value of different actions and impacts under future scenarios. ● contribute to leapfrogging the achievement of water-related SDGs, particularly in countries/regions with a high risk of failure to attain crucial SDGs under the business-as-usual scenario. It will likewise leverage intergovernmental processes and goals with inclusivity, co-ownership of Member States, and addressing fragmentary information and knowledge as high priorities.","UNESCO, WMO, UNDP, UNEP, UNCDD, IAEA, IAHS, ISC, Future Earth","Goal 1, Goal 6, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 15, Goal 17","1.5, 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 12.2, 13.2, 13.3, 15.1, 15.4, 15.5, 17.6, 17.7, 17.14","Thu, 06/16/2022 - 12:00","Sat, 11/30/2030 - 12:00",www.water-future.org,1.0,0.4444444444444444,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.49450549450549636

Our technology can be easily implemented in a cost-effective and scalable manner in all types of marine infrastructure . It’s based on an admixture and unique surface modifying agents, and specifically designed liners and form inserts that can be incorporated into any concrete casting methodes. Our solution has been validated in Europe, USA, and Asia., and recommended by the Dutch government, the US Nature Conservancy , and integrated in Waterfront Alliance’s Waterfront Edge Design Guidelines (WEDG). Our unique nature-based-design technology can easily be integrated in any marine construction projects, such providing solutions for the greater benefit of biodiversity, CO2 footprint, and infrastructure’s strength and durability. ECOncrete’s technology has been thoroughly tested and validated and is already in use in more than 40 projects, across 12 countries. In 2022 we successfully executed and implemented a number of infrastructure projects and we launched our new concrete solutions for Offshore Wind that generated great interest from industry, regulators and interest groups, such as The Nature Conservancy. We also receive continued international support and recognition from environmental initiatives, award-programs across industries, and NGOs (in 2022: “Innovator of the Year” nomination by European Patent Office, Solar Impuse Label, Energy Globe USA, Design Educates Gold Award, Engineering Awards in the USA and more). ECOncrete’s team of marine biologists, as well as independent teams of biologists from partner organizations, have monitored installations for a variety of biological performance indicators, such as species richness, biodiversity, and biological build up with many ECOncrete projects undergoing at least 2 years of biological monitoring. ECOncrete’s technology has been installed and tested in a variety of marine conditions globally, and shown success in temperate, tropical, and estuarine ecosystems. In all pilot studies, ECOncrete installations have grown covered with life. Across studies and pilot installations, the technology increased biodiversity, increased the ratio of native species, generated an active carbon sink. In addition to the obvious qualitative and ecological improvement that an improved shoreline ecosystem provides, economical/structural benefits range from improved conditions for various fields from fisheries to tourism.","With increased storminess and predicted sea-level rise, the fortification and concrete structures along our shorelines are ever growing at an increased pace requiring large and long time investments in marine infrastructure. Any marine construction - from ports to breakwaters to offshore wind - can be built with local concrete modified by ECOncrete technology. With that in mind our scope is to gain 2% of the 'wet concrete' global market. Today our technology is included many projects around the world, where advanced strict regulations are in place. Scientific monitoring, published in peer reviewed papers in cooperation with universities, shows the impact in terms of increased biodiversity and richness of species, carbon capture, water quality and other ecosystem services where ECOncrete technology was integrated in marine construction processes. With every m3 of gray concrete avoided, and with the integration of our technology, we can make a great difference and change how future (urban) waterfronts look and function. As we are providing a technology and solution to local manufacturers, we are ready to provide our technology at large scale, with little restrictions and limitations and environmental regulations should not overlook a technology addressing the marine construction ecological challenges, when the solution is already within reach.","Fondation Prince Albert II de Monaco, Biomimicry Institute, Solar Impulse, NY Waterfront Alliance , World Ocean Council","Goal 9, Goal 13, Goal 14","9.4, 9.b, 13.1, 13.3, 14.2, 14.a",,,https://youtu.be/hs16NkK7k0o https://youtu.be/hY0w_SeVeTk,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.16483516483516544

Having evolved from an ambitious startup, we are now an organisation that is rapidly scaling. The past six years have seen a substantial increase in our global footprint, and a growth in the number of courses and trainers operating in the Academy framework. ZDHC Foundation launched the first ZDHC Wastewater Guidelines (Version 1.0) in 2016. As a living document, open to updates and improvements, currently V2.1 can be found on our website. The discharge of wastewater containing hazardous chemicals could have a significant impact on the environment and human health. After a thorough study, the ZDHC Foundation found that 1. Current wastewater regulations are far from requiring zero discharge of hazardous chemicals. 2. Wastewater guidelines published by different brands, as well as amongst multi- brand consortia, vary greatly. The conclusion was that there is a need for uniform, global guidance pertaining to wastewater discharge quality, as well as testing and reporting, to enable a more sustainable industry. This is exactly where the ZDHC Academy comes in. In the UNESCO 1977 Tbilisi Declaration it is stated that “Environmental Education is a learning process that increases people’s knowledge and awareness about the environment and associated challenges, develops necessary skills and expertise to address the challenges, and fosters attitudes, motivations, and commitments to make informed decisions and take responsible action.” We believe that working together cross-sectoral, while sharing best practices, knowledge and an aligned global approach to building capacity via training and education in the field of wastewater management and effluent treatment, will support to reach the goal to reduce hazardous chemicals in wastewater discharge and thereby its impact on the environment and human health. Setting aside competition and focusing all on one goal: Improving water conditions world wide.","The UN-Water SDG 6 Capacity Development Initiative, the inter-agency coordination platform on freshwater, sanitation, and hygiene-related capacity development work that enables the United Nations system and its multi-stakeholder partners to 'deliver as one' in supporting countries to develop capacities to accelerate progress towards SDG 6.3 (6.3.1 & 6.3.2). In line with the inspiring work of this UN initiative, the ZDHC Academy strives to further develop ONE central capacity building and education Academy within its training and education platform, that focuses on Chemical Management, Wastewater, Effluent Treatment and Water Management for the textile, apparel, leather and footwear industry, together with its partner organisations in alignment with the ZDHC Roadmap to Zero Programme. We believe that by creating one entry point for global capacity building, communicating standardised methods, innovations and sharing best practices a system change can take place that enables and empowers individual, organisational and communal change. Direct outcome: The Academy is a global collaborative platform that offers capacity building activities focused on Sustainable Chemical Management, Wastewater, Effluent Treatment and Water Management. Individuals, organisations and communities able to implement changes based on acquired knowledge. Communication of aligned standards. Collaboration between different stakeholders and sectors to create capacity building initiatives (amongst others Academia, Manufacturing Facilities, Policy Makers, Brands, Multi Stakeholder Organisations). Long term outcome: Reduced pollution, especially hazardous chemicals, in wastewater discharge. Improved and increased water management at production facilities. Less untreated discharged water, less impact on the environment and human health.","ZDHC Academy works together with a wide range of organisations to enhance capacity building, training and education.

It provides a platform for innovative projects for and by young people, with over 400 members from over 50 different countries. On the road to the UN Water Conference in New York, the Swiss Water Partnership Youth aims at supporting all governments worldwide, including Switzerland, to meaningfully include young voices at the highest level, in discussions and actions related to safe access to safe water and sanitation for all. In concrete terms, we support the GYMW 30-30-30 youth target: By 2030, youth below the age of 30 years old must represent at least 30% of stakeholders engaged in water management and governance mechanisms, consultation and decision-making processes. As a first step to reach this target, SWP Youth has ensured the inclusion of water professionals below 30 years old at the UN Water Conference, through the Swiss national Delegation. To fulfill the 30-30-30 youth target by 2030, SWP Youth funds and supervises youth-led, local water initiatives worth 25’000 CHF around the globe. SWP Youth is a leading international voice for youth in the water sector and has been invited to present in several high-level forums, including the recent UN Human Rights Council Social Forum on Water and the Development and at the UNECE and WHO’s Meeting of Parties to the Protocol on Water and Health for the European Water Convention.

Adequate supplies of water of good quality are maintained for the entire population of this planet, while preserving the hydrological and biological functions of ecosystems, adapting human activities within the capacity limits of nature and combating vectors of water-related diseases. Innovative technologies, including the improvement of indigenous technologies, are needed to fully utilize limited water resources and to safeguard those resources against pollution. In view of this “water village” concept is required to eradicate water shortage and to make the village self-sufficient within its available resources.  The integrated management of water resources could only be possible through adoption of efficient and optimum use of irrigation water, which could only be ensured by judicious and economic use of irrigation potential whatsoever created to increase crop production. The integrated water resources management also includes the concept of rainwater management that has got an immense importance on the way to develop the rainfed farming system. In the areas of medium to heavy rainfall, there is ample scope of tapping excess rain water through suitable water harvesting structures for its subsequent uses as irrigation or to apply life saving irrigation to the crops. It has got relevancy particularly in installing small-scale irrigation system based on farmers’ participatory approach for sustainable crop production for maintaining sustainable growth and development of agriculture.
(1)	To provide suitable irrigation scheduling to crops for obtaining optimum crop yields with maximum economy of irrigation water;
(2)	To measure the intake, conveyance, regulation of water to the crop field for higher productivity including timely and effective drainage;
(3)	To formulate the procedures and principles of effective rainwater manage for the purpose of irrigation;
(4)	To determine the moisture dynamics and effective utilization of soil moisture for higher crop production; and
(5)	To find out the economics and social interpretations of irrigation scheduling to the field crops and B:C ratios;
(6)	To generate suitable technologies on rain water harvesting and recycling of excess water for its effective use for crop production;
(7)	To evaluate  suitable rice and other crop cultivars along with improved agro-techniques;
(8)	To utilize low land eco-system effectively through integrated farming with rice-vegetable and fish components;
(9)	To mitigate the arsenic problem in water with suitable technology available to the farmers;
(10)	To develop suitable agro-technologies for rainfed farming based on farmers participation and introduction of crops with less water requirement;
(11)	To replace the summer paddy by other substitute crop(s) without hampering the economic benefits of the farmers;
(12)	To utilize the plant protection measures more efficiently introducing IPM;
(13)	To introduce mixed crop in risk prone areas to ascertain the farmers benefits more effectively;
(14)	To increase the area under adaptive and innovative trials on several aspects of agricultural production enhancement activities based on participatory approach.","The programme on water resources management to the lowest appropriate level necessitates educating and training the famers as well as villagers at all levels and ensuring that women participate equally in the education and training programmes. Particular emphasis has to be placed on the introduction of public participatory techniques, including enhancement of the role of women, youth, indigenous people and local communities. Skills related to various water management functions have to be developed by municipal government and water authorities, as well as in the private sector, local/national non-governmental organizations, cooperatives, corporations and other water-user groups. Education of the public regarding the importance of water and its proper management is also needed.
These principles of implementation would have positive impacts on the development of the communities with adequate capacities. Those who establish the framework for water development and management at any level, whether international, national or local, need to ensure that the means exist to build those capacities. The means will vary from case to case. They usually include:
Creation of awareness programmes, including mobilizing commitment and support at all levels and initiating global and local action to promote in building up self sufficient water villages;
Training of water managers at all levels so that they have an appropriate understanding of all the elements necessary for their decision-making;
Strengthening of training capacities in developing countries;
Appropriate training of the necessary professionals, including extension workers;
Improvement of individual career structures;
Sharing of appropriate knowledge and technology, both for the collection of data and for the implementation of planned development including non-polluting technologies and the knowledge needed to extract the best performance from the existing investment system.
 Institutional capacity for implementing integrated water management should be reviewed and developed when there is a clear demand. Existing administrative structures will often be quite capable of achieving local water resources management, but the need may arise for new institutions based upon the perspective, for example, of river catchment areas, district development councils and local community committees. Although water is managed at various levels in the socio-political system, demand-driven management requires the development of water-related institutions at appropriate levels, taking into account the need for integration with land-use management.
In creating the enabling environment for lowest-appropriate-level management, the role of Government includes mobilization of financial and human resources, legislation, standard-setting and other regulatory functions, monitoring and assessment of the use of water and land resources, and creating of opportunities for public participation. International agencies and donors have an important role to play in providing support to developing countries in creating the required enabling environment for integrated water resources management. This should include, as appropriate, donor support to local levels in developing countries, including community-based institutions, non-governmental organizations and women's groups.","Bidhan Chandra Krishi Viswavidyalaya

The complex interconnections of freshwater systems demands that freshwater management be holistic (taking a catchment management approach) and based on a balanced consideration of the needs of people and the environment. There is  intrinsic linkage between water resource development projects and their significant physical, chemical, biological, health and socioeconomic repercussions. The overall environmental health objective was set as follows: ""to evaluate the consequences which the various users of water have on the environment, to support measures aimed at controlling water-related diseases, and to protect ecosystems"".
The extent and severity of contamination of unsaturated zones and aquifers have long been underestimated owing to the relative inaccessibility of aquifers and the lack of reliable information on aquifer systems.

Provide agriculture skills and employment for youth
To bring enhancement in individual Farmers Farms to produce more food.
To create Financial Freedom for Farmers and Youth.
We are going to visit local school and communities, organize hundreds of workshops and lectures to educate youth to green agriculture. It is necessary to increase crop yields, more attention should also be paid to the post-harvest segments of the agro-industrial production system: storage, processing, wholesale and retail trade. The only way to ensure access to affordable food while increasing incomes can be done only by enhancing the productivity and efficiency of the agri-food production system through the implementation of agricultural production technologies. Irrigation systems make it possible to grow crops more efficiently with improved yields. 
Advantages of Drip Irrigation:
* Uses 30–50% less water than other systems
* Prevents soil erosion and nutrient runoff
* Continuous flow allows water to penetrate deep into the soil and down to the roots
* Controls fungal growth

            Paper on ""Engineering, Groundwater, and Integrated Water Resources Management""",WFEO,France,Global,"Founded in 1968, under the auspices of the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organizations (UNESCO) in Paris, the World Federation of Engineering Organizations (WFEO) is an international, non-governmental organization representing the engineering profession worldwide. WFEO brings together national engineering organizations from some 100 nations and represents more than 30 million engineers from around the world.
The Agenda 2030 SDGs are based on findings from the natural and social sciences and other fields regarding the implementation of necessary changes to ensure the survival and prosperity of all people and all forms of life on the planet.
Engineering is present in all the SDGs, in the work themes of the objectives of the Decade and in the topics of the five interactive dialogues of UN 2023 Water Conference. But the role of the diverse engineering disciplines has not been perceived as central to the achievement of the SDGs among other disciplines in the social sciences and humanities, even in SCG-6.
Engineering has been able to adapt knowledge (scientific, indigenous, local and community science) to the needs of society and the environment, with particular attention to sustainability, circularity, and resilience of water sources. Thus, contributing to a sustainable, intelligent, and inclusive development. It should not be forgotten that there is an important link between a country's engineering capacity and its economic development.
Also, engineering education has changed a lot in a short period. To address SDG-6 goals and targets, engineers have expanded their thinking beyond strictly technical solutions, focusing more on environmental and social aspects, such as, “Do No Significant Harm” principle, gender-sensitive planning, human-rights-based approach, and leaving-no-one-behind, among others. Facing present and future water-related challenges (population growth, climate change, sea level rise, droughts, floods, etc.), engineers’ capacity goes far beyond traditional solutions providing the best response (grey, green and/or blue) to each specific case.
However, with half the world living in poverty and millions of people without sufficient water and food or sanitation, engineering is needed to support the progress of sustainable development across the world.
The objective of this commitment is to disseminate the engineering perspective on water issues related to the achievement of SDG-6 goals and targets through the publication of documents on WFEO webpage, taking into consideration that this SDG is interrelated with all the goals of the 2030 Agenda.","World Federation of Engineering Organizations (WFEO) brings together national engineering organizations from some 100 nations and represents more than 30 million engineers from around the world. WFEO is the internationally recognized and chosen leader of the engineering profession and cooperates with national and other international professional institutions in being the lead profession in developing and applying engineering to constructively resolve international and national issues for the benefit of humanity.

This has also ensured that women and girls do not travel long distances in a bid to access clean water for everyday use. This is because some girls have been losing out on school hours as they will be searching for water. Formation of water committees to make sure that vandalism is avoided.
Rehabilitation of sewer mainlines and reticulation to manage waste management which has proven to be a challenge within the community this is because waste had been flowing and therefore exposing the community to different diseases. This is in tandem with sdg 3 hence as the municipality we are thriving to make sure that waste management is our top priority.
Construction of vending  sites which are safe spaces for operating as opposed to open air spaces which pose as a risk to weather hazards due to climate change. at these spaces there is also ablution facilities to avoid open defecation in the area. These open spaces are accessible by all including the disabled by the provision of ramps which has made the stalls accessible for all hence promoting inclusiveness.
Support from the African Development Bank  for the rehabilitation of sewer treatment plants and main sewer lines which had been dilapidated and had been posing as an environmental threat to both humans and animals. Municipality has therefore taken an initiative in restoring the correct synergy between the household sewers and the treatment plants by provision of efficient treatment system  which do not harm the environment.
Water coverage and reticulation to promote accessibility to marginalized groups in the community this was the provision of safe water through a piped system limiting on time to access water as it is now easily available on ones doorstep. This has promoted SDG 3 through improved health within those areas. This has been achieved through support from sida through technical backstopping expertise by providing civil technicians and engineers. 
Awareness and advocacy campaigns on the impacts of bad environmental practices and also on looming hazards such as cyclones which bring floods. This has been done through ICT which is faster and more effective. In promotion of Green energy GIZ Germany built a borehole which is powered by a solar system hence using clean energy.

            The renovation of another 5 water system that need maintenance",Indigenous populations in conflict areas caused by illegal mining,Brazil,Latin America and the Caribbean,"The situation of the waters in the Brazilian Amazon deserves attention, especially in the regions most impacted by predatory activities, which generate deforestation and environmental degradation, such as illegal mining. In recent years, it is worth highlighting the dizzying growth of illegal gold mining, driven by the increase in the price of the metal and the drop in inspections, both due to the difficulties with the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as the alignment of the last Government with prospecting practices. As an example, since the beginning of the Bolsonaro administration, in the Munduruku Territory alone there has been a 363% increase in illegal mining, according to a survey by the Instituto Socioambiental. In 2018, the Federal Police released a report in which it is estimated that mining dumps around seven million tons of waste per year into the Tapajós River, with mercury being the main metal found. When released into the river, mercury is transported through the food chain, contaminating fish, which are the indigenous people's main source of food. Contamination by mercury in the human body can cause sensory motor neurological problems and other serious illnesses, affecting the nervous system of adults and newborns. A study with the Munduruku people published in 2020 by Fiocruz in partnership with WWF-Brasil indicated that all research participants were exposed to mercury. Of every ten participants, six had mercury levels above safe limits: about 57.9% had levels above 6µg.g-1, which is the maximum safety limit established by health agencies. Based on a mobilization of indigenous leaders, partnerships were established with civil society organizations in the search for water supply and treatment technologies, among them the award-winning PROJETO SAUDE E ALEGRIA / PSA, who has been operating in the region for over 30 years with health, sanitation, education, environment, income generation and other programs. During the pandemic years, intense work was carried out to install water and toilet systems in the Munduruku villages of the Middle Tapajós. They are social technologies self-managed by the indigenous people themselves, driven by clean sources such as solar energy, based on successful solutions previously developed by PSA with the support of AVINA FOUNDATION. The proposal is to continue activities in the Middle Tapajos and expand the experience to the High Tapajos region, where more than 13,000 Munduruku indigenous people live in the midst of water contaminated by illegal mining. It’s planned: - The installation of 4 new community water systems powered by solar energy; - The renovation of another 5 water system that need maintenance; - The distribution of filters to 8 new indigenous centers. Training is planned for leaders and indigenous multiplier agents for self-management of the systems. The work will be carried out in partnership with DSEI-Tapajos, the federal government agency responsible for indigenous health, so that the developed social technologies can be absorbed by public policies and gain scale, with a view to replication in other villages.","The initiative is part of a public-private partnership, where the idea is not to replace the government, but to join efforts in facing the difficult challenge of getting assistance to remote areas of the Amazon. It will focus on remote and isolated areas, where the logistical costs of assistance services are very high in view of the limited budget of government agencies, which end up having insufficient reach in these villages. In view of this, the proposal opens up the opportunity for the development of adapted, demonstrative, resolute and replicable solutions and social technologies, with lower cost and greater positive impact, in a co-creation process with indigenous and public agents. The result will be, in addition to improvements in the living conditions of the directly benefited indigenous populations, also the availability of these social technologies as references for dissemination in other areas via public policies. They will also be available through the Projeto Saúde e Alegria for other organizations, public or private, in Brazil or other nations, interested in replicating them in the respective regions with similar contexts.","FEPIPA

However, a statement is being made on behalf of the World Environment Council that all schools and colleges should actively participate in this activity.
Today's techno-savvy students are constantly busy with their mobile phones. While learning something new, they are quick to ask many questions but do not seem to make any effort to actually ask the same questions. Children and young people especially in the first few years of life learn new concepts, new things very quickly accepted. For example, children can speak a new language more naturally than adults.
Children's brains are like sponges. It is the responsibility of schools to create awareness in their minds towards their future ideals. It is necessary to go beyond just teaching them to read and write and also to teach them awareness on topics like 'Environment Conservation'.
*'World Environment Council'* is a globally active organization conducting various environmental awareness activities in all schools and colleges in India, which encourages students to connect with and protect the environment and also helps create more environmental awareness among the common citizens.
Under the innovative campaign 'Environment Protection Bank' many programs are currently being implemented on the following topics.
1. Let's go to nature.
2. Let's restore mountains and natural places.
3. Let's build a seed bank for future generations.
4. Save old and rare trees.
5. Save animals and all living things. (Bhutdaya paramo dharma:.)
6. Save rivers and oceans.
7. Educate everyone about the environment, embrace innovation and be conscious about the health of the environment.
8. Restoration of Biodiversity.
9. Use of renewable energy.
10. Use of environmentally friendly products.
Apart from this, the council helps to impart environmental education through various activities and campaigns in schools and colleges.

If approved, it would increase drinking water security for aprox. 1 million people before 2030.","Communities in the area of influence, Rural Drinking Water Committees in Colina, Lampa, Llayllay, Tiltil, Calle Larga, Los Andes, San Esteban, Nogales, Catemu, Panquehue and Lo Barnechea",Chile,Latin America and the Caribbean,"We recognise access to water as key enabler for social equality and prosperity. At Anglo American, our objective is to use, manage, and care for water through the lifecycle of our operations in a way that is socially and culturally equitable, environmentally sustainable, and economically beneficial. Globally, we have committed to reducing the withdrawals of freshwater in water scarce areas by 50% by 2030. For context, 83% of our operations are in water scare areas, including Chile. To achieve this, our goal for the Los Bronces mine in Chile is to stop withdrawals of freshwater for mining processes by 2030. This target supports our focus on improving access to water for communities and ecosystems. Key to achieving our commitment at Los Bronces, was the signing of an agreement with Aguas Pacifico in October 2022 to supply 500 l/s of desalinated sea water from its new desalination plant located in Puchuncaví, Valparaíso, scheduled to start in 2025. This is the first phase of our Integrated Water Security Plan (IWSP). This will enable us to nearly halve our current freshwater withdrawals. As part of this first phase, we will provide desalinated sea water to the communities of Colina and Tiltil, who are currently reliant on rural drinking systems facing declining groundwater levels and water delivered by truck. The agreement with Aguas Pacifico will not only contribute to decreasing freshwater withdrawals for our operation but also provide greater water security to 20,000 people. The second phase of the IWSP will be the implementation of an innovative swap scheme to increase the supply of desalinated water for human consumption providing500 l/s in exchange for treated wastewater to supply the operation. This second phase depends on a final board decision and its subject to the feasibility of environmental permits and project schedule. If approved, it would boost water supply in the Valparaiso region in Chile and increase drinking water security for almost 1 million people before 2030. The IWSP complements the existing Rural Water Program, which directly supports the management of the Rural Drinking Water Systems (APRs) Committees and is thus strengthens local water governance initiatives. This commitment to the communities is part of an ongoing journey of collaboration that started with conducting a catchment-scale water balance study in 2018. From that study, a strategic alliance with We-Techs, a Chilean water services company, was formed for the purposes of monitoring and managing water resources remotely through technology. To date, through this collaboration, we have implemented improvements in eighty-three APRs located in four provinces of the Metropolitan and Valparaiso regions (Chacabuco, Los Andes, Quillota and San Felipe). This has generated more than 35% increase in water availability and benefited more than 130,000 people through savings in energy consumption, reduction of mains water breakage and, most importantly, greater availability of water for human consumption. We will continue to collaborate with host communities and develop mutually beneficial strategies that contribute to greater water security for the region.","• Water availability for human consumption and sanitation will increase due to the cessation of freshwater withdrawals for Anglo American's mining processes in a water stressed area through the addition of between 170l/s (dry year) and 500 l/s (wet year) of potable water. • Increase water reuse (site and regionally), both through the recirculation of water at the operation itself, as well as the utilization of desalinated water and later treated wastewater - unsuitable for human consumption - to supply all the operation's needs. • Increase availability of water resources through access to desalinated water in two communities with water shortage problems (Colina and Tiltil), benefiting about 20,000 people. • Strengthening the communities' Rural Drinking Water Systems (APRs) for better management and increased water resource availability in the communities where Anglo American operates through the continuity and expansion of the locally run Rural Drinking Water Program, currently benefiting more than 130,000 people.","WeTech, Aguas Pacífico, Rural Drinking Water Committee in Colina, Lampa, Llayllay, Tiltil, Calle Larga, Los Andes, San Esteban, Nogales, Catemu, Panquehue and Lo Barnechea","Goal 6, Goal 9, Goal 12","6.4, 6.a, 6.b , 9.1, 9.4, 12.2, 12.5","Mon, 03/02/2015 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2030 - 12:00",,0.375,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

They also make clear the need to understand, monitor, protect, manage, and restore the natural environment. Earth (or Geo-) scientists are therefore essential to their successful delivery. We recognise, however, that ‘business as usual’ will not be sufficient to achieve the bold ambitions of the SDGs. 
To improve access to clean, reliable, and resilient sources of water, we need to build new bridges to allow the bidirectional flow of knowledge between the Earth science community and others engaged in delivering the objectives of the Water Action Agenda. This will be achieved by addressing the barriers that prevent access to Earth science data and expertise, supporting more effective decision making. In this context, our commitment is to improve the planning and implementation of sustainable development initiatives (particularly WASH programmes), by improving understanding of and helping to address the barriers that prevent and/or hinder access to and use of Earth science data.
We will deliver against this commitment between now and 2030 by (i) supporting the delivery and dissemination of research, (ii) supporting the training and development of researchers (particularly those from the Global South), and (iii) ensuring representation of Earth scientists at national, regional and international sustainability forums (particularly those focused on water management).

Multi-stakeholder interactive dialogues among the science, policy, business and development communities, alongside youth, were convened. Over the course of the last three months, 8 online regional dialogues and a global conference were convened to explore the water-related issues that will shape our future, and what actions we need to take to address them. Dialogues have taken place in West and Central Africa, Southern Africa, Eastern Africa, the Middle East and North Africa, Central Asia, South Asia and South-east Asia; the final conference took place in mid-February in Cape Town with 185 participants, who came from 44 organizations, 55 countries and 17 Youth co-Hosts.
As part of the process, more than 400 organizations were engaged across eight Global South regions from eight stakeholder groups – young water professionals and activists, policy makers and implementers from regional and national levels, local government and public water service providers, knowledge generators, the private sector, funders and investors, civil society and non-governmental organizations, and different water users.
Youth, who have the greatest stake in future water security, play a pivotal role as co-guardians of the dialogues and are co-leaders of mission- driven alliances for water research and innovation.
Following the UN 2023 Water Conference, the following actions will be taken: finalize the High-Ambition Missions and form strong coalitions to support them in creating pathways for collective action for implementation.","The High-Ambition missions will deliver impact at scale by aligning applied research, youth leadership, policy change, inclusive development, private sector action, and investment via mission-driven alliances built around each mission and supported by invested key stakeholders.

This is especially true of the MUGERE River which separates the MUHA and KABEZI communes. The waters of the MUGERE River flow directly into Lake Tanganyika. Following the deforestation of the protective trees of its banks, the torrential rains cause damages to the inhabitants such as the destruction of houses, cultivable lands and dwellings, the intoxication of the lake following the discharge of waste water and lands torn off on the banks of the river MUGERE. It is for this reason that the Lake Tanganyika shows tendencies of overflowing, which causes problems to the inhabitants of the littoral of the lake.
To get out of this impasse, a vast reforestation program must be agreed upon by the government of Burundi, the population and local and international NGOs in order to restore the forest cover on the MUGERE River shoreline and thus protect and fight against the destruction of houses and the intoxication of Lake Tanganyika.
Through this project, the Association proposes the creation of forest and agroforestry nurseries in order to make plant material available to allow the installation of micro afforestation in the beneficiaries of the project.
This project will also promote the employment of women and young people who will take care of the production and planting of trees on the MUGERE river shore.
Objectives of the project
Main objective
The main objective of the project is to produce and plant forestry and agroforestry plants on the MUGERE River shoreline to fight against its degradation and protect Lake Tanganyika. 
Specific objectives
- To produce 400.000 forestry and agroforestry tree seedlings and natural or autochthonous species.
- To train the beneficiary population on environmental education and rational management of woodlands.
- Train youth and women leaders on the production and planting of seedlings with good agricultural practices.
- Increase the income of unemployed youth and women in the communes of KABEZI and MUHA through the protection of the banks of MUGERE and its surroundings.
Before the project starts, the Association will hold, in collaboration with the administration, information and sensitization meetings for the youth so that they can understand the main goal of the project activities. During these meetings, much emphasis will be placed on the protection of the banks of MUGERE in order to fight against the disasters and erosion that are invading the surrounding neighborhoods and Lake Tanganyika. 
As implementation methodologies, during these meetings, the ASDD Association will elect committees among the beneficiaries of this project who will collaborate with the Administration in the execution of the activities. The association will recruit 30 young people and 30 women who will produce and plant tree seedlings and reeds.","Sustainability and visibility of the project
The sustainability of the project will be carried out by the local administrative authorities in collaboration with the beneficiary population. Also, the association will be able to support the Administration in the subsequent follow-up of the activities. 
The visibility of the project will be materialized by an exclusivity of the young people and women gathered to the works of development of the nurseries, production, maintenance, plantation of the produced plants.
Monitoring and evaluation of the project
After the selection of the beneficiaries, the ASDD Association in collaboration with the hill committees of development will mobilize the beneficiary population for the production of forestry, agroforestry and fruit plants. The monitoring of the activities will be ensured by the ASDD Association in collaboration with the hill committees of development and the representatives of the local administration.
Monitoring meetings will be held monthly to correct and adjust the remarks made by the monitoring missions.
As soon as the project starts, the high authorities of the province, the representatives of the technical ministries and the donors will be invited for the official launching of the project. Signs will also be erected at the project's implementation sites. Radio and television broadcasts will be presented.","ONU FEMME, Women's Peace and Humanitarian Fund, Care International, Actionaid, Union Européenne, Fondation IDA","Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 13, Goal 14, Goal 15, Goal 17","1.1, 1.2 , 1.4, 1.5, 1.a, 2.1 , 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 , 2.5, 2.b, 2.c, 3.1, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.7 , 3.8, 3.9, 3.c, 5.1 , 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 , 5.5, 5.6, 5.a, 5.b, 5.c , 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.a, 13.b, 14.1, 14.3, 14.7, 14.a, 14.b, 14.c, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5, 15.6, 15.7, 15.a, 15.b, 15.c, 17.1, 17.19","Sat, 05/20/2023 - 12:00","Sun, 04/20/2025 - 12:00",,1.0,0.7777777777777778,0.6666666666666666,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

The main purpose of this collaboration and advocacy project is on scaling up the constitutional amendment on ""Right to Children"" in India under the purview of Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009, which ensures that all schools in the country must have adequate safe drinking water, sanitation facilities including separate toilets for boys and girls and facilities for hygiene especially menstrual hygiene management (MHM) among adolescent girls.
The program on WASH in Schools (WinS) has profound impact on the learning interest of children, especially girls. Girls are reluctant to go to schools due to lack of appropriate toilet and hand washing facilities and consequently become vulnerable to drop out of schools. WinS initiative in India has reported to increase girl’s participation in studies, in developing positive hygiene behaviors both in schools and homes, and in extending such good practices into their families. Also children are  reported to be powerful agents of change not only in their homes but also in the community. In short, the activity indicated that school children to a great extent act as messengers of “good hygiene practices” in the society. 
The Women’s Health and Education Center’s (WHEC’s) advocacy and communication global projects and programs aim to elaborate strategies that strengthens national policies to implement the Sustainable Development Framework. These opportunities are especially designed to help girls, women and minorities so that they also can achieve their full potential. WHEC’s publications are aimed at a broad range of audience, and it is hoped the everyone who reads this comes away with a realization of the complexity of the issues at stake, and an appreciation of the work that lay in front of us. Evidence shows that, this can create the transformation, necessary to secure more peaceful, fairer and more inclusive societies for everyone, and a better globalization.  
Exploring the Relationship between Sanitation and Mental Health and Social Well-being:
When people perceive or experience a lack of privacy and safety, during open defecation or when using sanitation infrastructure, this can negatively influence their mental and social well-being. the authors of this study found that perceptions and experiences of privacy and safety are influenced by contextual and individual factors, such as location of sanitation facilities and user’s gender identity, respectively. Privacy and safety require thorough examination when developing sanitation interventions and policy to ensure a positive influence on the user’s mental and social well-being. The world has seen a dramatic increase in out-of-school rates, for both girls and boys in developing countries.","Our objectives and impact
1.	To ensure the basic Right of the Child such as safe drinking water and sanitation and hygiene facilities under the preview of Right to Education (RTE).
2.	To scale up the observation by the Supreme Court of India on Right to Education (RTE) that every school in India has requisite number of teachers, potable water, toilets, safe building, and other such facilities for students.
3.	All developing countries need to endorse Right to Education (RTE) as a fundamental right to all children including potable water, separate toilets for boys and girls, privacy of girl students and MHM facilities.
4.	Partnerships with governments, donors, community-based organizations (CBOs), non-governmental organizations (NGOs), teachers, children and school administrators are essential elements to achieve the sustainability of school sanitation and hygiene education programs.
5.	To highlight the duty of all stakeholders to convey the message that ""children are effective agents of change and schools are the ideal places of learning for children; and that they have a crucial role in the process of community development"".
6.	To support efforts to implement environmental awareness/school sanitation/hygiene education in school syllabus for a healthy school environment. Capacity building is needed at all levels.
7.	Child friendly especially girl child and disabled friendly water and sanitation design options essential.
8. Reduce Maternal, Newborn, and Child Mortality and Morbidity by safe drinking water and Sanitation in healthcare facilities, and in the communities.

One of the strategic goals of IZTECH is to advance its position to a leading academic institution in its priority research areas including water resources, sustainability, climate change and renewable energy. Accordingly, IZTECH focuses on water theme especially by giving priority on “Water-Energy-Food Nexus”, “Sustainable Economic and Urban Development”, “Transboundary and International Water Cooperation”, “Cross Sectoral Cooperation”, “Climate” and “Resilience” fields. Within this context, “Water Resources” graduate program, which started to accept students in 2010, constituted the first step of IZTECH's education program on the subject. Then, due to the high demand for the program and the increasing importance of the subject, “International Water Resources Department” was established in 2020. The department, supported by the Council of Higher Education, accepted its first master's students in the 2020-2021 and the first Ph. D students in the 2021-2022 period. Many undergraduate students from African, Middle East and Asian countries are participating in the program besides Turkey.","IZTECH has strong institutional commitment to sustainability. Its educational and research activities address SDG 4, particularly SDG 4.7 by ensuring that all learners acquire the knowledge and skills needed to promote sustainable development, including, among others, through education for sustainable development and sustainable lifestyles. Most recently, IZTECH published Sustainable Campus Policy Document in October 2021 and adopted economic, social, and ecological sustainability as a basic principle in terms of education, research, and benefit to society. In addition to the development of corporate culture and organizational capacity with a participatory structure, IZTECH committed itself to organize social events to raise awareness, to provide training and research opportunities to the relevant stakeholders on the theme of sustainable development and climate change, and to review and renew its education and research plans regularly. Therefore, IZTECH aims to attend the UN 2023 Water Conference to promote deeper understanding, uncover new learnings and reinforce existing best practices in water for development issue. Moreover, IZTECH research staff and graduate students have a particular focus on geothermal energy. They carry out advanced research projects to assess overall supply potential of 'critical' raw materials (CRM) carried by geothermal fluids and to enlarge an existing geothermal fluid atlas by collecting new data and sampling wells for their CRM content in Europe and East Africa. The project will advance key reference points for stakeholder engagement, in order to obtain and maintain a 'social license to operate'. CRM-geothermal will open up a potentially huge untapped resource and deploy solutions to help Europe fulfil the strategic objectives of the EU Green Deal and thereby serve the agenda for SDG 7, ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all. Furthermore, in line with the SDG 6, particularly 6.5, by 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate IZTECH International Water Resources Department Curriculum comprises graduate level courses such as the IWR 514 Water Politics course, which aims at bridging the gaps within the science-policy-practice interface to influence sound decision-making based on scientific knowledge and evidence. The course outcomes and methodology provided evidence of how inter- and transdisciplinary approaches can lead to meaningful and lasting impact on students by providing new relevant knowledge and strengthened capacities on sustainable water policy and management. On the other hand, in the past twelve months, the IWR 514 course convener has published scientific articles and volumes, and also acted as the project coordinator or member of international research projects, which are closely related to the UN 2023 Water Conference main themes, particularly Water for Cooperation: Transboundary and International Water Cooperation, Cross Sectoral Cooperation and Water Across the 2030 Agenda.","Horizon 2020, 2021 and 2022, European Commission Research Executive Agency

The 7 basin committees of metropolitan France - water parliaments that bring together all stakeholders and decide on water management in a river basin - vote on international cooperation strategies every 6 years, which are implemented by the water agencies. Actors in public development aid, the French water agencies are thus committed alongside the local authorities in their territory in the collective effort to achieve the SDGs. These actions can also be financed within the broader framework of the external action of local authorities.
The French basins thus encourage, through technical and financial aid, projects led or supported by local authorities which, in partnership with other local authorities abroad, contribute to increasing access to water and sanitation, and also enable progress to be made towards achieving the SDGs related to health, education, gender equality and reducing inequalities.","The funding and partnerships of French local authorities have been steadily increasing since 2005, supported by the funding of agencies (440 million USD since 2005, half of which by local authorities and the other half by water agencies). In 2021 alone, more than 200 French local authorities have supported actions in favor of partnerships in the South. These projects have also resulted in the development of territorial partnerships in France, as well as in the countries of the South.","Basin committees, local authorities, development agencies, governments, networks of elected officials, civil society associations, diasporas, networks of water professionals","Goal 1, Goal 3, Goal 4, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 10, Goal 15, Goal 17","1.1, 1.4, 1.a, 3.3, 3.9, 4.1, 4.2, 4.5, 5.5, 5.a, 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.a, 6.b , 10.2, 15.6, 15.b, 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 17.6, 1.2 , 1.5, 10.3, 15.a, 17.9, 3.2, 4.3 , 4.7","Wed, 03/22/2023 - 12:00","Fri, 03/22/2030 - 12:00",www.pseau.org/fr/observatoire/france/panorama-national,0.875,0.1111111111111111,0.25,0.0,1.0,0.9890109890109927

            Further expansion of D-LeaP in terms of programs and countries reached",Other regions to which D-LeaP model can be transferred,"Albania, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Montenegro, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Serbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Ukraine",Europe,"Although access to water and sanitation services in the Danube region is high compared to the rest of the world, some areas still suffer from inadequate water service provision and sanitation.  Governments and water professionals in the Danube region face a double challenge of meeting their citizens’ demand for universal, good quality, efficient, and financially sound or - in one word - sustainable water and wastewater services, while catching up to the environmental requirements of the European Union acquis communautaire. 
To address these challenges, the World Bank and the International Association of Water Service Companies in the Danube River Catchment Area (IAWD) have been running in partnership the Danube Water Program, with a 17 million Euro, four-phased financing from the Government of Austria. Launched in 2013, the DWP is an advisory and capacity building initiative in the water sector that aims at strong utilities, smart policies and sustainable services in the Danube region.  The Program is targeted in particular at (i) water supply and wastewater sector policy makers and regulators; (ii) senior technical and managerial staff of water supply and wastewater utilities; and (iii) senior level staff from water supply and wastewater associations.
One of the key, consistent challenges faced by the countries in the Danube region, and as identified by a regional review (State of the Sector report, World Bank, 2015), is related to the capacity building needs of professional staff working in the sector. In part this is due to staff and management turnover following political changes, and in part due to limited professional development and training opportunities. To address this, DWP established in 2016 Danube Learning Partnership (D-LeaP) as a regional, integrated and sustainable capacity building initiative of national water utility associations and IAWD, which aims to provide a comprehensive curriculum to the staff of water supply and sanitation utilities located in the Danube region. D-LeaP delivers a set of capacity building programs to participating utilities and professional staff several capacity building programs as part of a virtuous cycle of Check – Plan – Do performance improvements.  The programs which are offered to the 17 countries in the Danube region are grouped in three main categories: Foundation Programs (Benchmarking, Utility Management Training); Technical Programs (Energy Efficiency, Non-Revenue Water, Water Safety Planning and Crisis Management, Commercial Efficiency, Asset Management); Implementation Programs (Access to Financing).
D-LeaP presents a unique game changer model in its organisational set-up, as it uses the know-how of private sector to develop programs at the regional level, and the expertise and resources of national water associations to deliver the programs with their local experts (the Hubs), in the respective national languages of the Danube countries. In addition, the governance model of D-LeaP provides a shared ownership among the national water associations, that are implementing the programs.
The commitment is to further advance the implementation of D-LeaP in the Danube region, and to potentially copy D-LeaP in other regions across the world, to support the implementation of SDG6, and to achieve sustainable WASH services for all.","Capacity development is essential for supporting financing, service delivery, innovation and data management needed for sustainable and equitable WASH services. Professional water associations can play a significant role in (1) developing and implementing regular capacity development programs, in (2) creating national training institutions and in (3) in establishing standards, regulations and professional certification.
In consequence, IAWD together with its members, the national water associations in the region, has designed the Danube Learning Partnership (D-LeaP) to provide a comprehensive curriculum to the staff of water supply and sanitation utilities located in the Danube region. This mechanism allows the national water associations to offer eight regionally developed training programs following learning-by-doing principles and delivered by national experts and in local language. In total, 487 utilities in 13 countries have been trained since the launch of D-Leap in 2017. 
IAWD together with its member water associations are committed to further advance the implementation of the D-LeaP programs, that target performance improvements of water utilities across the Danube region, and as a result contribute to sustainable and equitable WASH services for the population. A skilled workforce is the backbone of a strong utility, which are the precondition to accelerate the implementation of SDG6. In addition to the Danube region, the proposed action aims to reach out to other regions, beyond the Danube, and to make the model of D-LeaP accessible to other interested water associations and water Utilities.","The International Association of Water Service Companies in the Danube River Catchment Area (IAWD), National Water Associations in the Danube region, Danube Water Program",Goal 6,"6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b",,,https://www.iawd.at/files/File/library/d-leap/D-LeaP_brochure_0222.pdf,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.6593406593406618

Recognizing the power of peer learning, the UN has been calling for operators to support one another since 2006. Aqua Publica Europea (APE) and its members are actively involved in this global challenge and have been sharing their knowledge with peers, through the UN-led Global Water Operators’ Partnerships Alliance (GWOPA), since 2011. Dozens of APE members have participated as mentors to their counterparts in developing countries.
Building on its active membership within this global movement, APE launched ‘Water Erasmus’ in 2017: an initiative that fosters knowledge sharing and peer-to-peer learning among public water operators, members of APE. The objective of the initiative is to develop and strengthen the capacity of public water operators to address common environmental and societal challenges, as well as to promote a shared culture of water management based on the values of efficiency, affordability, innovation and the strong involvement of elected officials and citizens in strategic decision-making.
The initiative is based on an ‘on-demand’ approach: following a request for support from an operator, one or more exchanges (online and/or in person) are organized with other operators that have best practices and experience to share on the challenge. Since the launch of the project, more than 30 exchanges have been organized on a wide range of issues, from digitalization to energy efficiency and nature-based solutions. The value of the initiative has been recognized by European Institutions.  
Aqua Publica Europea commits to opening participation in Water Erasmus knowledge exchanges to utilities from developing countries that are not members of APE, free of charge. To identify and connect potential beneficiaries, Aqua Publica Europea will work in collaboration with the Global Water Operators' Partnerships Alliance – the UN Habitat initiative that promotes capacity development among water utilities worldwide – of which APE is a member.","The effective work of local water utilities is crucial for the achievement of the SDGs. APE members and their peers in developing countries contribute through their work to all the SDG6 targets, from universal and equitable access to water and sanitation to the protection of water-related ecosystems.
More specifically, our initiative is linked to SDG6.a. The action is expected to facilitate and support the capacity development of public operators in developing countries in all aspects of drinking water and sanitation management. Through the flexible, on-demand approach of the Water Erasmus initiative, knowledge exchanges – especially online – are easily accessible to public utilities worldwide and can represent a useful complement or introductory action to the more structured partnerships for capacity development promoted in the framework of GWOPA.
In particular, these exchanges should allow public water and sanitation utilities to learn from their peers – in a simple and quick way – about concrete management and technological solutions that have worked (or not) in other contexts and to assess the replicability/adaptability of these solutions to their own context.","The Global Water Operators' Partnerships Alliance (GWOPA)

            By 2030 the Water Flow Diagram is used by cities around the world to decrease inequalities and increase resilience. Public-public partnernerships have been created among cities and municipalities connecting their local actors from science, civil society and private sector.",Cities around the world,"Brazil, Honduras, Mauritania, Philippines, Senegal, Switzerland","Africa, Europe, Asia and Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean","This is joint contribution of Swiss actors from science, politics and practice to empower municipalities around the world to work towards reducing inequity and increasing resilience in urban water management.

It is based on four commitments:

1) We engage in action-oriented cooperation at the interface between science, politics, and practice.

2) We promote easy-to-understand tools, such as the urban Water Flow Diagram, to understand challenges and opportunities in water management.

3) We encourage solidarity-based city-to-city or utility-to-utility partnerships to build empower local actors and to build joint visions to reduce inequity and increase the resilience of cities.

4) We work with private sector initiatives that provide innovations to implement local solutions.

Urbanisation in a changing climate provides specific challenges, but also opportunities, to reach SDG6 and the human right to water and sanitation (HRWS). Key challenges are inequalities and conflicts of interest in water resource distribution, overexploitation, pollution, and water related hazards, such as droughts and floods. The opportunities are economies of scale, improved stormwater harvesting, and circular approaches, using synergies between different water users. To manage urban water, it is necessary to know its flows and stocks and the issues at stake. We engage in action-oriented partnerships at the interface between science, politics, society and the private sector to create a joint vision and to trigger action.

Applied science: The Water Flow Diagram (WFD) is a visual tool that shows in one picture all the water resources and flows within a city and identifies the challenges and opportunities related to SDG6 and the HRWS. It connects information related to both Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) and assists in the creation of a joint vision to prioritise action.

Local action by the civil society: The WFD was developed by scientists (Eawag) in collaboration with local actors, mostly in Rio Pardo de Minas, Brazil, and civil society support (Swiss NGOs - HEKS and Helvetas). This collaboration embedded the development of the WFD into a participatory process from data collection to multi-stakeholder dialogue and a joint vision for action.

Political commitment: The development of the WFD was supported by the City of Bern, a Blue Community. While financially supporting the activities in Brazil, Bern developed its own WFD. The WFD is now also being applied as part of city-to-city and utility-to-utility partnerships supported by Solidarit’eau Suisse. The partnerships go beyond financial support and includ capacity building through harnessing skills and knowledge and visits by political leaders.

Private sector innovation: The Swiss Water Partnership unifies Swiss actors from science, policy, NGOs and the private sector. By connecting the drops, it uses the power of the private sector and of youth to scale up innovations that can help make contributions towards SDG6 and the human right to water and sanitation (HRWS). We invite municipalities around the world to join us in this journey by making their own WFD and engage in partnerships to prioritise action towards SDG6 and the HRWS.","Our approach demonstrates how joint action at the interface between science, politics and practice can trigger commitment and action among stakeholders along the entire urban water cycle. We invite municipalities around to make their own WFD and engage in partnerships that will activate local actors from academia, civil society and the private sector. The expect impact is a better urban water management where inequalities are reduced and resilience increased. This will be achieved through: evidence, dialogue, and commitment to action: Evidence: the urban water flow diagram provides a visual summary of issues at stakes. Partnerships: allow an empowered multi-stakeholder dialogue to solve conflict of interests and prioritise actions. Political commitment: results in an enabling environment to put actions into practice together with the private sector and civil society.","Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC)

            4.	Facilitate training and certification of rainwater harvesting technicians, support for policy formulation and standard setting, organization of conferences, knowledge sharing and promotion through social media and publications.",International Water Association (IWA) Rain Water Harvesting and Management  Specialist Group,"Bangladesh, Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Guinea-Bissau, India, Kenya, Malawi, Mexico, Nepal, Pakistan, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Uganda, United States of America, Vietnam",Global,"The initiative aims at promoting Rainwater Management in response to international agendas (SDGs 2, 6, 13) and to integrate rainwater management as a sustainable solution to climate extremes (drought, flooding, loss of soil, etc.).
More specifically, the commitment focuses on strengthening initiatives, synergies and networking in the promotion and dissemination of rainwater harvesting (RWH) systems as a sustainable, effective and appropriate solution to the challenges of climate change.
As a global alliance of rainwater harvesting practitioners, IRHA and its partners commit themselves to continue to promote and facilitate through training, standardization and demonstration to foster increasing access to suitable rainwater harvesting solutions to enhance water security for households and institutions, so far left behind, for sustainable agriculture and watersheds, and for commercial establishments (factories, hotels) that are water intensive. 
Current water supply coverage still leaves out 7 to 11% of the world population. Households do not have ready access to safe water or face seasonal shortages. Remoteness and physical difficulties may prevent centralized water services to arrive for quite some years. Rainwater harvesting and safe storage offers a solution up to 6% of the world population as a regular supply or as a supplement. Schools and healthcare centre similarly face water shortages and can benefit from rainwater collection and safe storage.
Rainwater harvesting is insufficiently valued as a water supply option mainly because storage is deemed expensive. Households view it differently as they collect rainwater by any means possible to offset the inconvenience and costs of the lack of a regular supply. 
Adequate public awareness together with local knowledge and skills on water storage technologies and management will help diffuse the practice of rainwater harvesting raising water security and resilience. In the process the Alliance will  also encourage the private and public sector to adopt rainwater harvesting practices to reduce the water footprint of their operations. 
The Rainwater Harvesting  Alliance is networking and collaborative entity composed of several national rainwater harvesting promotion and capacity development associations. National associations provide information about key benefits of rainwater harvesting further focusing on training and capacity building, knowledge sharing and policy development. Members work together to raise the profile of rainwater harvesting through events, joint publications and international conferences. Regular webinars and  information sharing channels will be used to strengthen the local knowledge and capacity.  
The Rainwater Harvesting Alliance is gradually gaining capacity in effective promotion of specific techniques and approaches through exchange of experiences and participation in each other’s conferences. The Alliance members aim to work with funding agencies to develop joint demonstration projects in domestic and institutional water supply, in agriculture and watershed restoration, in ecosystem services and urban rainwater management. Projects will vary according to context and will be implemented by local NGO partners, in collaboration with all relevant stakeholders.","The Alliance will develop an explicit collaborative structure, in which Alliance members/partners represent the IRHA as appropriate. Knowledge capital is produced internally jointly by and for Alliance members. The Alliance includes and supported actors who share the RWH theme and promotes RWH at national and international levels.
The impact of the Alliance, and its national members, will be in the growing implementation of rainwater harvesting and management related projects and project components in all Alliance countries (SDG 17). Every year 1-3 additional national rainwater associations are expected to become members of the Alliance and will further strengthen the national capacity to develop and update rainwater harvesting and management policy  and promote and implement projects that will expand water supply services and agricultural water storage. As a result water security at home and in the community will improve, raising livelihoods and economic resilience.
The improved water security will contribute to health (SDG3) through safe water (SDG6) for the household and more water for personal hygiene (incl.menstrual); to education (SDG4) as girls in particular will be able to attend school regularly, to end hunger and improve nutrition (SDG2) as rainwater near the house will enable the household to grow vegetables and hold some livestock.
Using climatewise water management techniques, conservation combined with sustainable land management will contribute to sustain and strengthen watersheds and their ecosystems (SDG 15).
Rainwater harvesting and management is also pertinent to industry and cities. Large manufacturing complexes can reduce their water footsteps by collecting and managing the rain that falls on their property (SDG 9). In the city, buffering of rain, managed artificial recharge, and various other ways to use rain before it runs off can be used to reduce water shortages and have sufficient water available for greenery, thus also reducing heat stress (SDG 11).
At a higher administrative level, Alliance members will come forward to advise government on broader policy objectives related to water resources management, nature-based solutions and urban rainwater management, among others.
It will eventually lead to national capacity to close the gap to universal coverage on SDG 6.1, and contribute to more climate resilient agricultural practices, watershed restoration and ecosystem protection, and water sensitive urban adaptation, by 2030.","Rainwater Cambodia (RWC, Cambodia); Lanka Rainwater Harvesting Forum (LRHF, Sri Lanka); South Asia Rainwater Network (SARNET, Sri Lanka); Clean Water - Healthy Village (Netherlands); Rainwater Harvesting Association of Malawi (RHAM, Malawi); Rain for All (South Korea); American Rainwater Catchment Systems Association (ARCSA, USA); Asociación Mexicana de Sistemas de Captación de Agua de Lluvia A.C.

Companies are assessed on performance across their own operations and supply chains and specifically measure companies on their contribution to water quality, water withdrawal and water sanitation. The methodology acts as a roadmap, translating the water-related goals into clear expectations and guidance for companies and by sharing best practice. By assessing companies every two years progress is tracked, providing an accountability mechanism on how companies are contributing to the 2030 Agenda. 
The water assessment is part of WBA’s wider Nature Benchmark Methodology, which measures the worlds most influential companies on their efforts to protect nature and biodiversity, aligning with the goals of the Global Biodiversity Framework. The methodology is built on existing standards and best practices, while also recognising developing concepts. It will be updated after each full benchmark cycle, to ensure the most up-to-date science and knowledge is reflected. Methodology development and review are built on an extensive consultation process, and guided by the Expert Review Committee, which is made up of members from WBCSD, SBTN, GRI, Capitals Coalition, WWF, Columbia Center on Sustainable Investment and TNFD.
In WBA’s 2022 assessment of 400 companies, there was more reporting on water relative to other more novel nature topics, however performance is still lacking and there is little evidence of a consistent and unified approach to water. For instance, companies are reporting against different metrics, leading to data being difficult to compare and only a number of them are setting time-based targets. In 2023 WBA will assess a further 400 companies and in 2024 the full 1000 will have been assessed for the first time.","There are increasing calls for improved transparency and accountability on corporate performance toward global agendas, such as the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework calling for large businesses to assess and disclose their risks, impacts and dependencies on nature, including water. Equally, companies are stepping up to lead on water stewardship. The UNGC’s CEO Water Mandate has over 200 companies pledging to reduce water stress by 2050, committing to action and transparency in their operations & supply chains, community engagement and calling for more ambition in public policy. 
However, a mechanism is needed to sufficiently assess how private sector actions are contributing to achieving the water-related goals. Without comparable information, impact cannot be captured which contributes to a corporate accountability gap. As a result, the majority of companies avoid their responsibility and don’t take the urgent action that is needed. Equally, those that do live up to their responsibility are not rewarded accordingly. 
WBA’s commitment to assess 1000 of the worlds most influential companies on a bi-annual basis helps close the corporate accountability gap. The benchmark assessments not only help individual companies identify where they need to take action, but provide evidence for other stakeholders in the ecosystem to find ways to be more effective in holding companies to account and encourage accelerated action on SDG implementation. Multilateral systems, which hold global agendas, have a key role to play and must create the pathways to credibly include corporate contributions into global stocktakes and allow for greater coherence in bringing together different stakeholders to discuss and take action on water challenges and the broader 2030 Agenda. 
The 1000 companies are assessed on challenges that intersect with the other SDGs. WBA can share insights from its Nature Benchmark that speak to water challenges, but companies are assessed more broadly on climate, nature, social and governance topics, thus taking a systems lens.","WBA operates as a multistakeholder alliance of 350+ organisations aligned with our mission to drive company progress on the SDGs.

The SDG 6 IWRM Support Programme assists governments in designing and implementing country-led responses to SDG indicator 6.5.1, the degree of implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). It provides a unique platform for bringing together stakeholders from all water-impacted sectors in each country, engaging them not only in the SDG 6 reporting exercise, but also in enhancing the understanding of stakeholders of the integrated nature of water and in planning and implementation of specific water resources management actions to progress towards water-secure, resilient societies and economies and protect and preserve healthy ecosystems. Under the auspices of the Support Programme, partners from national authorities, civil society groups, sectoral organisations and businesses are able to work together to assess the status and challenges of water resources management, identify priorities and continue to implement selected priority actions. 
To support this process, the Support Programme is structured around three stages: 
Stage 1 – Identifying challenges: Employ SDG 6.5 national monitoring and reporting frameworks to identify, through multi-stakeholder consultations, critical areas for attention that hinder progress on IWRM. This stage involves the completion  of the SDG indicator 6.5.1 survey, designed to support countries to evaluate their degree of implementation of IWRM, re-assessed every 3 years. So far, more than 70 countries have been directly supported in facilitating stakeholder consultations for SDG 6.5.1 reporting. In this phase (2023-2026), 180 countries will benefit from the technical support provided to submit the survey, of which 60 countries shall be assisted directly in stakeholder consultations for SDG 6.5.1 reporting. 
Stage 2 – Developing Action Plans: Building on the key challenges to IWRM implementation identified in Stage 1, Stage 2 aims to facilitate a government-led multi-stakeholder process to formulate and prioritise appropriate responses to those challenges. The result of Stage 2 is typically an IWRM Action Plan (the name might be adapted for each country), which constitutes a series of attractive investment opportunities to systematically guide the implementation of solutions to water resources management challenges. So far, 20 countries have designed an IWRM Action Plan, and in this phase (2023-2026), 25 more countries will be supported to develop IWRM Action Plans. 
Stage 3 – Implementing solutions: The Support Programme has already provided seed funding to implement 16 actions, and will support 10 additional countries in this phase (2023-2026) in implementing the designed IWRM solutions aimed at achieving SDG 6 and other water-related goals as a measurable contribution to countries’ progress towards their water-related SDG targets. Solutions may include, amongst others, those that improve: climate resilience (SDG 13, UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)); water quality and reuse (SDG 6.3); water-use efficiency (SDG 6.4, SDG 2.4); ecosystem and biodiversity management (SDG 6.6, SDG 15, Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF)); disaster risk reduction (SDG 11.5, Sendai Framework); gender and equality (SDG 5, SDG 10.1)","IWRM addresses interlinkages.  
Integrated approaches to water and land management, which can be developed through implementing IWRM, is fundamental to achieving a range of targets under all 17 SDGs and other global, regional and national sustainable development frameworks. Implementing IWRM is therefore critical to addressing the interlinkages needed to achieve the SDGs - harnessing synergies, and managing trade-offs.  
Multi-stakeholder dialogue.  
Through supporting the acceleration of IWRM implementation, the SDG 6 IWRM Support Programme therefore supports acceleration towards a range of SDG targets. One of the fundamental ways it achieves this is by bringing together stakeholders from across sectors, including agriculture, aquaculture and forestry, industry and mining, poverty and development, energy and climate action, and environment. Facilitating this multi-stakeholder dialogue in an inclusive and transparent manner supports countries to reach consensus on key priorities, harnessing synergies and managing potential trade-offs.  
Global to local.  
Furthermore, the operating structure of the Support Programme – and direct link to SDG reporting, including through the Integrated Monitoring Initiative on SDG 6, coordinated by UN-Water (IMI-SDG6) - allows it to harness global and regional learnings, working within shared frameworks, but supporting implementation at the country level, including through Country Water Partnerships, even involving and supporting local and vulnerable stakeholder groups.  
Mobilising resources.  
Each country assisted through Stage 2 will develop an investment plan on water resources management, which looks to measurably advance both SDG 6.5 and other water-related SDG targets across sectors. This will help to mobilise financial resources from multiple funding streams – including national budgets, multilateral and bilateral funding sources, climate and environmental financing mechanisms, amongst others – in support of the implementation of those plans. Countries supported through Stage 3 may receive extra assistance in mobilizing finance for specific activities. This should lead to measurable improvements in the management of water resources, as measured through SDG 6.5.1 and other SDG 6 indicators.  
Water for all. 
Ultimately the expected impact of this assistance is to increase resilience to climate change and ensure equitable and sustainable access to, and use of, water across all uses by enhancing the way water is being managed and governed.","GWP, UNEP, UNEP-DHI, UNDP Cap-Net and DHI (and liaising with various regional and thematic development partners).

            Implement 59 large scale community wide safe water wash initiatives","Children, women, and men are direct beneficiaries in vulnerable communities in low to mid-income countries. Projects will include small home-scale projects for the elderly and extended family members (20ppl), medium-scale projects for clinics, schools, and outreach centres (1000ppl), and large-scale community projects for entire communities (1000-10,000ppl). By 2030 we expect to additionally impact 435,000 people; 36,000 individuals through home-scale projects, 104,000 through medium-scale projects, and 295,000 through community-wide initiatives.","Colombia, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Liberia, Rwanda, Uganda, Zambia","Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, Global","H2O4ALL recognizes that health inequalities are best addressed using a life course approach (Halfon & Hochstein, 2002). This approach recognizes that health status at any age is influenced by current circumstances and “prior living circumstances, in utero onwards” (Kawachi, 2002, p. 650). The most effective way to empower women and girls is to encourage a safe and healthy early life environment—a strong determinant of their health and well-being as adults. H2O4ALL continues undertaking projects both serving and advocating for the health and rights of women and girls, underlining the organization’s priorities in choosing its partners and projects.

H2O4ALL’s strategy towards achieving the greatest impact is through education, training and community engagement. We provide the tools that allow communities to take ownership of their water needs and leadership in developing solutions. Through our ground partnerships H2O4ALL collaborates with local community members, government authorities, and faith communities to identify water-related needs, select beneficiaries, and implement project activities. H2O4ALL initially engages with local council leaders, religious leaders, and opinion leaders in the community to build trust and a deep understanding of their water-related needs. After jointly identifying how safe water can best be delivered, community members are trained to assist with the water project’s installation and maintenance once completed. These collaborations and partnerships enable H2O4ALL to reach the most vulnerable communities highly effectively and sustainably.

As part of H2O4ALL’s work, we have undertaken health impact assessments, social surveys, environmental scans, and rigorous testing of our technologies in partnership with local universities. From these experiences, we now have tested tools to evaluate and monitor our work. The project implementation checklist collects detailed information on a) availability of improved water sources (and 5 liters per person per day according to WHO/UNICEF guideline standards), the economic and physical costs (e.g., the average distance traveled) of water collection, the adequacy of equitable sanitation for all with special attention given to needs of women and girls, and any available health programming on hygiene and sanitation. To assess the short-term impact (6 month) of the project, our project partners will be tasked with tracking activity progress against set indicators (e.g., gallons of water delivered to each ward, water quality, days missed at school due to illness). Additionally, H2O 4 ALL will conduct an in-person site visit six months and one year after the projects have been implemented. The midterm evaluation will focus on: a) the determination of levels of achievement and b) actions for going forwards.

To assess the long-term impact (1 year afterward), H2O 4 ALL will prioritize in-person site visits. Our project partners will be responsible for providing report updates and continuing maintenance on the water systems as needed. Additionally, at the one-year mark, H2O 4 ALL will explore possible expansion and improvement opportunities at the project site and neighbouring areas. The organization will have established relationships with community members and want to continue supporting significant water needs.","At H2O4ALL, we state that water is essential for human well-being, environmental sustainability, and economic development. It is also a cross-cutting issue that is directly linked to SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation). Therefore, improving access to water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services, promoting sustainable water management practices, and protecting water resources can simultaneously positively impact several SDGs.

We believe that through our action of a community-based approach to the implementation of safe water and WaSH initiatives, we can work together to help accelerate SDG implementation and address interlinkages, including:

1. Integrating water management and community-led solutions on a village and community level, we can influence government leaders with their plans and policies: We would be advocating for the incorporation of water-related issues into the development planning of communities, districts, and countries can ensure that water resources are sustainably managed and used to promote economic growth, social development, and environmental sustainability.

2. Our safe water and WaSH initiatives will directly Improve access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene: By improving access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene, countries can improve health outcomes, reduce poverty, increase economic productivity, and promote gender equality.

3. Our initiatives will also be educational with our on-the-ground partners to enhance water-use efficiency: By promoting water-use efficiency in agriculture, industry, and households, countries can reduce water scarcity, increase food security, and promote sustainable economic growth.

4. Lastly, as we work alongside villages and communities, we will be protecting and restoring water ecosystems: By protecting and restoring water ecosystems, countries can preserve biodiversity, mitigate climate change, and improve water quality.",,Goal 6,"6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b","Sun, 01/01/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2030 - 12:00","Website

            Joint mechanisms and capacity created & integrated early warning systems between in-country and global partners","Local communities, hydromet offices, national and subnational government in Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan and Uganda","Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan, Uganda","Africa, Global","Water at the Heart of Climate Action is a new initiative geared towards mitigating the impacts of water-related risks and disasters and increasing the resilience of vulnerable communities in Ethiopia, Sudan, South Sudan and Uganda. Global and national policies on climate, disaster risk reduction (DRR) and water are often siloed and disconnected from and not informed by the actors at the local level. To adapt to a changing climate, a combination of early warning and early action measures that support integrated water management is necessary to save lives and livelihoods in vulnerable communities.
This initiative takes the local perspective as the starting point and includes vulnerable groups in the design of interventions aimed at reducing their vulnerabilities and strengthening their capacities. It focuses on long-term resilience strengthening measures and targeted action to improve the forecasting and early warning system capacity of regional and national actors,. These systems generally suffer from a disconnect between national and local early warning systems, fragmentation and lack of ownership by the local communities. 
Speedy and effective action requires policy, climate and hydrological products and services, national and local disaster management actors to collaborate, with strong coordination between local communities and authorities, national and global actors. Next to the locally-led character, this initiative is unique as it brings together three international organizations with a global mandate on technical areas: (i) International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC), (ii) United Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction (UNDRR) and (iii) World Meteorological Organisation (WMO). 
These organizations will be working together under the umbrella of the Centre of Excellence for Climate and Disaster Resilience and will be further strengthened by a dedicated UN multi-partner financing mechanism to fund global weather and climate surface-based observations: the Systematic Observations Financing Facility (SOFF). The aforementioned organisations will deliver climate and hydrological products and services to support national and local disaster management actors. By unlocking barriers across the whole hydro-meteorological (Hydro-Met) value chain, this partnership will model a way of working that can be scaled and replicated.","This initiative aims to enable different actors at global, national and local level to more effectively manage water-related risks. This strategy has been developed recognizing that the current climate change and water crisis in Africa are inextricably linked and require systemic changes. This intervention plans to drive that change using an integrated climate and water approach to deal with increasing exposure to water related risks. A change of systems and mindset is done by bringing together different disciplines in the water, climate and disaster management sectors and fostering the collaboration of global, national and local partners that traditionally have been working separately. This will be done by breaking barriers among sectors and organizations and establishing a model of cooperation that will enable different actors to achieve common goals. The aim is forging new relationships that will go on to deliver other strategic results in future, beyond this initiative.
This initiative is structured around five broad technical focus areas:
1.	Water-related risk knowledge and governance - accelerating the investment in risk-based decision making;
2.	Observations, monitoring and forecasting of weather and water-related hazards – strengthening regional, national and local hydro-met capacity;
3.	Water specific early warning systems, dissemination and communication – reducing the disconnection between communities and national level early warning systems;
4.	Anticipatory Action and Locally Led Adaptation – integrating anticipatory action with longer term actions aimed at improving the climate resilience of communities with a user-centered approach;
5.	Crosscutting activities – ensuring cross fertilization of learning and efficient knowledge management.","IFRC Network*, UNDRR, WMO, SOFF

While there is increasing awareness of water importance, there is still a need for more effective, integrated and coordinated actions, coupled with strong political will in recognizing, valuing and managing water in a holistic and integrated manner to achieve all the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  To foster national actions to  address water-related challenges and to sustainably use water for achieving all SGDs in a systemic manner, FAO is supporting member countries, upon request, in the development of country-specific National Water Roadmaps through country-led dialogues and participatory processes, following the example of the National Pathways for Food Systems Transformation, developed  by 116 countries in the background of the UN Food Systems Summit 2021. 
Recognizing that national governments are at the centre of water governance, such National Water Roadmaps or strategies will help to strengthen the inter-sectoral coordination on sustainable water resources management and accelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.  The Roadmaps could review and reaffirm water-related objectives and commitments in the existing agendas and strategies, including (intended) Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and/or National Adaptation Plans (NAPs), UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Frameworks and Common Country Analyses, national water plans/strategies, and other related national development plans and commitments. Furthermore, the National Water Roadmaps towards 2030 Agenda could be shared as a voluntary commitment during the UN 2023 Conference on Water.  
FAO, together with members and partners of UM-Water, will provide both technical and financial support to the national water dialogues and the development of National Water Roadmaps. This initiative has been endorsed in the Dushanbe Declaration and by FAO Council in December 2022, and, so far, 20 countries or so have expressed interest to join this initiative.","Due to the irreplaceable water in achieving all SDGs, , the development of National Water Roadmaps will enable the countries to not only make strategic choices with regards to water allocation to different sectors, users and regions, but also to mobilize resources to speed up the SDGs so as to achieve all other SDGs as envisioned by the Agenda 2030. The Roadmaps can set up ambitious targets and measures to for example improve water services delivery, water use efficiency and reduce water pollution across all sectors and achieving the SDG6, as well as other SDGs that are interlinked with water, such as SDG1, SDG2, SDG 12 and SDG13, among others. The most important contribution by the Roadmaps will be to define and develop a national roadmap to equitably and sustainably use water to achieve all SDGs in holistic and coordinated approaches.","UN-Water (incl.

We do this by:

Promoting Public Water Awareness and sharing
	Educational Content Showcasing
	Partners in Water Conservation
	Efficient Use and Sustainable Solutions
	Encouraging Partnerships and Celebrating Results (All Stakeholders)
Valuing Water, understanding the challenges and acting accordingly, requires a significant mindset change, supported by technical solutions.

#SurplusWater2025 welcomes partners who are:

Committed to Water and pledge to take action
	Actively work towards a 20-25%+ reduction in water footprint of ALL water-users
	Make use of or provide sustainable supplementary solutions
The power to ONLY use the water you need, is in everyone's hands. This is the one thing, each of us can do immediately and that has an immediate effect. The quickest, easiest, and most cost-effective way to make an impact, is to focus on demand. If we can reduce demand, together, we can reduce our supply deficit.","With the 30+ private sector contributing partners currently participating, the combined water savings has resulted in more than 3 million litres PER DAY... and counting.

Current Achievements:

Partners focussing on monitoring, awareness and efficiency alone, consistently result in an average of 20%+ reduction in demand.
	Partners who combine efficiency with sustainable alternative water solutions, are reporting an average in excess of 40% and in some cases up to 80% reduction in water demand.
Water efficiency is not a once-off action to lower consumption, it is critically important to KEEP consumption down. The key is continuous monitoring and acting accordingly.

Reducing demand not only protect the source of water, but also reduce the 'generation of waste'/effluent water. Efficient use is the very first step.

#SurplusWater2025's Water Action is aiming for at least 20% of high water consumers to simply use water efficiently and reduce their demand by 25% or more, to reach the tipping point and achieve Surplus Water.

Just imagine the impact on the water network, on alternative water sources and on the natural water cycle if ALL water users commit to achieve these results.","The #SurplusWater2025 movement is a growing community of dedicated companies and individuals committed to a 20-25%+ reduction in water demand.

Meticulous and months-long researches have been carried out to finalize this book. It includes all vital information about our precious asset water, the global conflicts and wars over water, suggestions on how to mitigate or even end these conflicts and wars, advice and tips how to safe water, etc. 
The author of this book is touring in Germany to present this book and give lectures on this topic. The focus of this book: in earlier times, wars have been fought over oil but in future, wars will be fought over water because within the next years/decades water will be an even more scarce commodity due to the climate change. It takes joint forces on a global scale in order to prevent these upcoming wars. Water scarcity is not only responsible for wars between states and continents but it also takes away the basis of life for humans and animals, it causes hunger and leads to displacements and streams of refugees.","Many people, in particular, in the first world countries, take water for granted. They have it in abundance and are not aware of the problems and fights over wars. They know about the problems in some regions of the worlds such as Africa but it is too far away from them. They do not appreciate water as one of the most precious goods that humans have. Hence, they spend it too freely. In many cases, water is polluted because of ignorance, unawareness and greed.

            Plantation of 4000 mangrove saplings by youth groups of Sundarbans",Community and Youth Groups of Kolkata and Sundarbans,India,Asia and Pacific,"The project “Climate Wall”, an initiative created in association with US Consulate General Kolkata and led by Sukrit Sen, helps students understand their environment and its challenges. As part of the project, a physical climate wall teaches young leaders about the different species of mangroves and helps them develop effective strategies for collecting and growing them in nurseries. Once their roots are long enough to withstand the tidal forces, the seedlings are finally planted on the riverbeds. The virtual wall uses creative arts such as paintings, dance, poetry and music as mediums to raise climate awareness and encourage community members to get involved in local governing bodies for water management. The project is based in the Sundarbans village of Hingalganj, at the border between India and Bangladesh. There we are currently working with a local organisation called “Breathing Roots” to help schoolchildren learn the importance of mangroves as well as growing techniques so that they can withstand tidal pressures. We also discuss ways that students can take action to help mitigate climate impacts and understand how our own lifestyles can contribute to climate change. Workshops over the past year have involved media such as art, dance and poetry. The last stage of this project will include another round of tree planting to reinforce the surrounding areas against future cyclones. Apart from these, one of the main outcomes of this project will include a Bhatiyali song, a genre of music believed to have originated with boatmen who would compose songs based on their long and lonely journeys and what they learn from their surrounding environment. Bhatiyali singers have thus been documenting climate change for much longer than conventional researchers, who coined the term climate change only in the late 1970s.While this genre of music was long neglected by newer generations, the song being written will be composed and sung by our youth partners. The goal is that it will be able to serve as a local medium of interpretation and inspire future generations – they too have much to contribute to the scientific discourse of our current times. The final outcomes of the “Climate Wall” project will be available toward mid-2023 on the Living Waters Museum portal.",The aim towards this project is to use innovative and creative tools beyond just awareness to penetrate those circles of the community who have not been made a part of climate action so far. This technique helps develop creative advocacy for climate change but also creates mediums for the continuity and safeguarding of traditional and knowledge and cultures further inspiring future generations.,"US Consulate General, Kaolkata","Goal 8, Goal 9, Goal 11, Goal 13, Goal 15, Goal 16, Goal 6","8.3, 8.4, 9.1, 9.4, 11.4, 11.6, 11.7, 11.a, 13.1, 13.3, 13.a, 13.b, 15.1, 15.5, 16.7","Sat, 01/01/2022 - 12:00","Fri, 06/30/2023 - 12:00",https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-can-art-song-help-bring-worlds-largest-mangrove-swamp-back-/?trackingId=K2bnQ347T3mjXnKUjaPllg%3D%3D,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.6666666666666666,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

Zambian Citizens",Zambia,Africa,"The goal of the Zambia Water Investment Programme (ZIP) is to transform and improve the investment outlook for water security and sustainable sanitation in Zambia in line with the national aspirations for a prosperous, peaceful, inclusive and equitable country by 2030. Thus, the goal is for a water-secure Zambia by 2030. The main objective of the ZIP is to enhance job creation through gender-sensitive investments in water security, industrialisation and climate-resilient development. The programme is structured around three investment focus areas (IFAs): water investments to support economic transformation; resilience building through water investment; and water and sanitation governance and institutional strengthening. The coordination and management approach will be anchored in existing national development coordination arrangements under the Eighth National Development Plan (8NDP) and the existing coordination arrangements for dealing with climate change. However, the Ministry of Water Development and Sanitation (MWDS) will shoulder the primary responsibility of the ZIP. The ZIP is also a programme that falls within the Continental Africa Water Investment Programme (AIP) that was adopted  by the African heads of state and government in February 2021 during the 34th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union. The main expected result from the pan-African AIP is the leveraging of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) investments worth about US$30 billion annually by 2030 and the resultant creation of five million jobs over the same period.","The key results that are expected from the Zambia Water Investment Programme include the leveraging of about US$5.75 billion for water security investments and the creation of about 200,000 formal jobs and about 800,000 indirect jobs by 2030 particularly for vulnerable and poor youth, women and other marginalised groups.

The goal of this cluster strategy is to improve the operation and management of water utilities to put them on a growth trajectory by turning the vicious cycle into a virtuous cycle of improved service, more efficient operations, securing tariff income, and securing investment.
The creation of such self-sustaining and growing water utilities is the key to achieving the SDGs, and it is important to increase the number of water utilities with sound management to mobilize private sector funds.
To achieve this goal, JICA will adopt an approach that starts from the expansion of the tariff revenue base and improvement of services through facility development and an approach that starts from the increase of revenue and profit and improvement of services through the reduction of non-revenue water.

            TWP 3.0 Upcycling","We are purposefully targeting our wastewater treatment technologies for use in developing nations that need sewage system retrofitting, as our technologies are an effective solution for countries looking to adopt modern best practices in an affordable and environmentally sustainable way. Tomorrow Water will share certain intellectual property (IP) with the global community with the goal of implementing TWP around the world.",Republic of Korea,Asia and Pacific,"Tomorrow Water, an innovative environmental solutions provider with a vision of a “Clean and Beautiful World Beyond Waste”, contributes to the world via SDG 3 Good Health and Well-being, SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation, SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG 13 Climate Action, SDG 17 Partnerships for the Goals. Tomorrow Water Project (TWP) is a comprehensive system that converts sewage from a cost stream to a profit stream by integrating low-energy wastewater systems, AI-based value chain innovation, and rigorous resource recovery. TWP is contributing to the global paradigm shift toward the digital transformation of the water and sanitation industries. BKT is following the suggestions and guidelines made by ASD to resolve polarization issues regarding clean water and sanitization, renewable energy, IT-related infrastructures, and climate change response. BKT and ASD firmly believe that water and sanitization are rights to be provided to all without discrimination. The goal of TWP is to build a sustainable waste and wastewater management system, integrating low-energy wastewater treatment, energy production, and other crucial elements of modern infrastructure in one place. Through BKT and ASD’s joint project TWP, BKT established ways to generate renewable energy through biogas plants and built centralized data centers along with AI-based design, construction, and management. Through the integrated process of heat exchange and the three AI-based systems, the sewage system and the data center can reduce energy consumption and produce renewable energy (biogas) utilizing organic waste such as but not limited to sludge from sewage and food waste. Thus, ASD encourages BKT to make ‘Leave No One Behind’ come true with TWP, which meets the 7 UN SDGs: SDG 3, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, and 17. TWP has completed its first stage, the Development of Treatment Solutions, and is in the Value Chain Innovation stage (2021-2025). On top of developing treatment solutions, TWP will incorporate design and engineering, construction, and operation to expand the scope of TWP. For many developing nations, the use of energy-neutral treatment solutions rare inaccessible if the entire value chain is unaffordable. Water AI and automation technologies can solve these challenges, which can immediately and inexpensively optimize wastewater treatment processes and negate the need for costly engineering work and operations. TWP was officially registered as an initiative on the UN SDGs Platform by BKT in March 2016. In July 2016, ASD introduced and submitted written statements about BKT’s sustainable management models to the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) commission’s High-Level Segment (HLS). The same month, the ECOSOC HLS unanimously selected TWP as the most economical sewage disposal solution. With ASD's support, BKT has been delivering the highest quality water and producing renewable energy based on low-cost, highly efficient innovative technology and sustainable management since March 2016.","BKT, under the guidelines provided by ASD, has been developing ways to solve issues in clean water and sanitation, renewable energy, and IT infrastructures. As encouraged by ASD, BKT has been producing biogas with Draco and AAD technology. This is to prevent methane gas from causing global warming, stench, wastewater, and fine dust through integrated management of organic waste. Currently, BKT is working on developing WAI-Design and WAI-Operation technology for establishing an eco-friendly data center that will secure design, construction, and management for AI-based design and management economically. Moreover, the company is developing Proteus+, Mainstream, and AMX technologies that will help resolve sewage problems. This will be done by creating a model that will utilize Mainstream AMX to remove nitrogen after removing organic waste and solid matter from a single reaction tank. ASD strongly believes that the technologies BKT is developing will accelerate SDG implementation. The technologies currently being developed will produce economic and clean water that is suitable for each regional characteristic, create economic feasibility by reducing energy consumption while producing renewable energy, establish accessibility of necessary IT infrastructures and advanced technology, and apply to all developed and developing nations. Thus, the technologies of BKT will meet the 7 UN SDGs: SDG 3 Good Health and Well-being, SDG 6 Clean Water and Sanitation, SDG 7 Affordable and Clean Energy, SDG 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure, SDG 11 Sustainable Cities and Communities, SDG 13 Climate Action, SDG 17 Partnerships for the Goals.","BKT Co.

The GW-Project is led by Dr. John Cherry, recipient of the 2020 Stockholm Water Prize, GW-Project Leader and Chair of the Board of Directors. The GW-Project manages key activities with a small staff, with support of a 10-member Steering Committee, and relies on contributions from many more volunteers (authors, reviewers, editors, translators).
The GW-Project’s mission is innovative in that it encompasses an entire realm of environmental science (all things groundwater) documented by volunteer experts from around the globe in online books aimed at education for readership at all levels and all global circumstances to serve humanity and our Planet’s ecology. The GW-Project is aimed at raising groundwater consciousness and strengthening groundwater expertise worldwide, in addition to making groundwater knowledge accessible for everyone everywhere. 
Key to the mission of the GW-Project is fostering rapid dissemination of knowledge and learning tools to universities everywhere including those in developing countries so that those with inadequate teaching resources for comprehensive groundwater education can direct students to synthesized knowledge at a high global standard. Emphasis is on overcoming inadequacy in knowledge and technical resources for improved access to safe drinking water in both remote rural areas and large urban centers where there is water poverty, as well as on understanding and avoidance of contamination of Earth’s groundwater resources.
 
The GW-Project publishes original books in four categories and 20 domains: (1) Children’s Books - dedicated to all sorts of groundwater information for children; (2) Introductory Books - covering a wide  range of groundwater topics and written for a broad audience; (3) Overview Books - comprehensive books that cover groundwater topics in a larger context in a descriptive manner (mostly without equations); and (4) Specialized Books – tailored towards groundwater education at the university level and continuing education for groundwater professionals. Since its inception in 2017, the GW-Project has successfully created a list of hundreds of books within carefully selected topic areas and domains, encompassing nearly the entire scope of groundwater. 
The GW-Project has developed an educational philosophy and methodology for implementation of the project and has a formalized, rigorous, peer-review process for all materials issued by the GW-Project. The GW-Project’s vision of book writing has an emphasis on visual content (diagrams, freehand sketches, schematics) as the primary means to create readily understandable and engaging books.
Each book is a stand-alone copyrighted publication, to be published in other languages. All publications can be downloaded for free from the GW-Project website (pdf format) and are freely available as webbooks on our website. Since the publication of its first book in 2020, the GW-Project has published 30 original books, with 27 books in our review and production process and 200 more in preparation. Furthermore, 33 book translations have been published and 118 book translations underway (covering 44 languages).","The UN Secretary-General's message on World Water Day (March 22, 2019) stated that 2.1 billion people live without safe water, and that growing demands, coupled with poor management, have increased water stress in many parts of the world. Climate change is adding dramatically to the pressure, and by 2030, an estimated 700 million people worldwide could be displaced by intense water scarcity. The global water crisis is urgent and requires innovation to identify, prioritize, and accelerate global solutions. The focus must include groundwater because it makes up 99% of the Earth's liquid freshwater. Groundwater is key to the UN Sustainable Development Goal 6 (ensure access to water and sanitation for all) but also directly contributes to poverty eradication (Goal 1), food security (Goal 2), gender equality (Goal 5), sustainability of cities and human settlement (Goal 11) combatting climate change (Goal 13), and protecting terrestrial ecosystems (Goal 15).
Over the next 5 years our vision is to include books and knowledge that address key issues in indigenous communities, developing countries, children’s education and that includes state of the art interactive learning modules to assist in this learning. We foresee the preparation of road maps that outline critical learning for specific regions to help guide instructors in developing countries who are beginning to build courses from the ground up. Road maps will be designed for geologic regions, water quality issues and political considerations.","The Groundwater Project currently  has over 1000 well-recognized scientists and practitioners (including retirees) working as authors, translators and reviewers. These contributors are associated with over 300 organizations from 95 countries. Groundwater Project books have been downloaded over 130,000 times from 174 countries since the first book release in August 2020.

As such, the cooperation supports sustainable, resilient economic development in Cartagena, in line with key policy ambitions such as the ‘Plan 4C Cartagena Competitiva y Compatible con el Clima’ (2014) and the ‘Plan Integral de Gestión del Cambio Climático’ (2022).
Water as Leverage (WaL) is a methodology developed by the Government of the Netherlands, together with international partners. The methodology of the programme is built on the recognition that a result-driven, holistic and inclusive project preparation approach is the best way to kick-start and create scalable sustainable solutions for urban climate adaptation challenges. This methodology is based on a transformative strategy which looks at the complete urban fabric from a physical, social, economic and cultural point of view. These solutions should be bankable, embedded in a local context, supported by decision makers locally and nationally, and also bringing a long-term and sustainable impact.
Building on the successful Water as Leverage for Resilient Cities Asia program – which focused on the cities of Chennai (India), Khulna (Bangladesh), and Semarang (Indonesia) – and its generated lessons learnt, the current Water as Leverage approach and processes challenge three critical gaps from the earliest stages of project preparation for climate-resilient urban water projects:
1.	Driving process and project innovation grounded in a holistic problem definition.
2.	Building coalitions and facilitating resource mobilization
3.	Facilitating the development of bankable projects from the start","Two multidisciplinary teams, consisting of international and Colombian experts, will be responsible for generating concrete, implementable, innovative and integral conceptual designs (Phase 1), followed by the development of project proposals to pre-feasibility level (Phase 2), and later developed into ready-to-tender projects (Phase 3). It is the objective of Water as Leverage to deliver significantly different, design-driven solutions to water- and climate change adaptation related challenges, aiming for leverage through investments in infrastructure. The projects must address climate change adaptation and/or urban water management challenges with a focus on physical infrastructure, as well as count on local partners’ support and collaboration. The multidisciplinary teams become an integral part of the Water as Leverage Cartagena process, facilitated by the Government of the Netherlands, in partnership with the Alcaldía de Cartagena de Indias, Colombian national authorities and national/international strategic partners.","Ministry of Infrastructure & Water Management of the Netherlands

By numerically representing the attainment of the goals progress over time can be measured and presented. In this particular case the European Water Framework Directive Article 7.3 states “Member states shall ensure the necessary protection for bodies of water identified with the aim of avoiding deterioration in their quality in order to reduce the level of purification treatment required in the production of drinking water”. However no metric was formulated to measure the attainment of the policy goal of ""a reduced level of purification treatment required in the production of drinking water."" To this end an index was developed based on the legal requirements for drinking water which are compared with the actual raw water quality that are taken in for drinking water production. By including data all the way back to the start of the WFD in 2000 we were able to show that the water quality of the lower Rhine (at the Dutch-German border) did not improve in terms of WFD art 7.3. It did also show that the water quality of the upper Rhine (at the Swiss-German border) did improve in terms of WFD art 7.3.We have presented our results in the working group ""Monitoring"" of the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine and are now working together with national representatives to update our data set and improve our collective understanding as to why and how regional differences arise. The method was published as an open access paper (link in the additional information) and the underlying R-script has been made freely available as well as a training data set. The method can be freely used and easily be adapted to other policy goals either by NGOs alone or by multi-stakeholder collaborations.","Whereas the results (visuals and data) of the index themselves can be an accelerator for implementing and achieving policy goals, the process of developing a common multistakeholder understanding of the parameters in the index are equally valuable for creating acceptance of the results and its implications. By capturing unparameterized policy goals numerically stakeholders are enabled to mirror the results back to those who are responsible for implementation. In our case we mirror the WFD 7.3 promise of a reduced level of purification treatment back to our policy makers using the legal requirements of the drinking water regulations for clean and wholesome drinking water which are also set by the same policy makers. By presenting the results in the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine we elicited the interest of upstream partners leading to an assessment across the whole catchment and a commitment to continue to monitor future progress.","KWR Water Research, Nieuwegein, The Netherlands","Goal 6, Goal 16, Goal 17","16.6, 16.7, 17.14, 6.5, 6.6, 6.b","Tue, 03/21/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 03/21/2028 - 12:00","The open-source paper and additional information can be found here: A water quality index for the removal requirement and purification treatment effort of micropollutants.

The centralised access to data and information will significantly increase capabilities to guarantee better planning and decision making in water management and climate change adaptation. The expected outcome of the project is to design a data portal which is an integrated one-stop for the water related information available over different portals and platforms, to link data through open-source software (contingent upon data owners’ authorization) and to describe and support the provision of services based on a unified geospatial data portal and highlight their benefits.

This database is the heart of FAO’s portal to monitor Water Productivity through Open access of Remotely sensed information (WaPOR). Currently, WaPOR covers Africa and the Near East and is being used by a range of different users, ranging from policy makers and researchers to extension services and farmers.  

In developing and maintaining the database and reaching out to a range of different users, FAO has been partnering with IHE Delft Institute for Water Education (IHE Delft), the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), and a public private consortium of Dutch and Flemish institutions. FAO intends to partner with the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Copernicus programme (the European Union's Earth Observation programme) to expand the area to cover the whole globe by 2023.","WaPOR is the first high resolution database that combines information on biomass production and evapotranspiration (ET) on a continental scale. With different spatial resolutions, ranging from 250 meters for continental applications to 30 meter for selected pilot areas, in combination with a 10-day time interval and available data since 2009, WaPOR is an unprecedented source of information to assess and support agricultural production and agricultural water management. 

The implementation of the WaPOR programme triggered a growing demand for practical applications and locally relevant solutions from FAO Members all over the world. The continuation of the database for the area currently covered by the WaPOR database and an expansion towards a global database is therefore strongly recommended. The database can be used for trend analyses on (i) area cropped, (ii) crop production, (iii) water use, and (iv) water productivity which are all key for understanding the evolution of food production and whether the implementation of policies, projects and subsidies have had the impact anticipated. Global time series analysis will reveal more information on sustainability, vulnerability and the impacts of agricultural practices under different bio-physical and socio-economic circumstances in a changing climate.","IHE-Delft, IWMI","Goal 2, Goal 6, Goal 13, Goal 15",,"Thu, 01/01/2015 - 12:00","Wed, 12/31/2025 - 12:00",https://wapor.apps.fao.org/,0.0,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05494505494505515

We stand for meaningful work, which helps our employees to live more meaningful lives. With nearly 40,000 employees in Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Switzerland, we make a positive contribution to society every single day. Our home base is located in Voerendaal, the Netherlands near to the place where the international family owned business that we are today was first founded in 1943.
Vebego aims at reducing water use with 20 liters of water per hour of cleaning compared to the global industry average. This is achieved through focus on innovative cleaning methods, cleaning materials equipment and effective use of cleaning solution. For every cleaning hour, Vebego donates the equivalent of 20 liters of clean water in developing countries to Made Blue Foundation.
Made Blue Foundation invests proceeds in the construction of water-related hardware such as deep wells, piping, public water fountains and water kiosks in schools and communities. By measuring cost input for hardware as well as water output to beneficiaries Made Blue Foundation is able to monitor delivering up to the claim of matching the 20 liters of water saved per cleaning hour by making available 20 liters of water to people in need.
Made Blue Foundation is registered as a charity in the Netherlands and is governed by an independent board (non-paid). Made Blue Foundation is audited externally both on finance and impact.","To date the Vebego - Made Blue partnership has resulted in 200,000,000 liters of clean water being made available by Made Blue Foundation. This provides access to clean water and hygiene to over 2.500 people today and for at least the next 10 years to come.
In developing regions, bottled water is often sold in plastic bottles or plastic bags and in small quantities: this makes it affordable to those having to make a living with less than a Dollar a day. When access to tap water is not available, cheap plastic bottled waters often are the best available option. That makes the lack of access to tap water one of the main sources of plastic waste pollution according to experts. This is the case in urban areas and also in about half of our projects. Rivers originating in developing regions in Africa and Asia carry the vast majority of plastic waste straight to the oceans. By making clean water available to those who need it the most, Made Blue Foundation helps to eliminate plastic waste at the source. The Vebego Cleaning Services Made Blue Foundation partnership has prevented an estimated 2.000 tons of plastic waste polluting the environment.
Also, by making drinking water readily available, carbon emissions are avoided as a result of preventing the usual boiling of polluted surface water. Research learns a ceramic water filter reduces 1,10 tons of CO2 per year per filter. Conservatively, with 10 users per filter and the UN figure that 1 person needs at least 20 liters of water per day, the filter is good for 73,000 liters per year. This means that 1 million liters of clean drinking water provides a CO2 saving of 13.74 tons and 1,000 liters provides 13.74 kg of CO2 savings. This is the case in about half of our projects, resulting in an estimated prevention of 1.400 tons of carbon emissions in the Vebego - Made Blue Foundation partnership.
Achieving SDG 6 requires an estimated USD 114 billion investment per year. Public funding is not enough and less than USD 5 billion is funded by donors. Private capital is essential to reach the target, but is only 1.36% of total private finance.
The benefit-cost ratio of the investment in water and sanitation is considered as 7 to 1 in developing countries. Poor sanitation, water and hygiene leads to 675,000 premature deaths per year and losses up to 7% of GDP per year. Finally, the human suffering by especially women and girls due to collecting water is immense. It keeps them away from education, paid labor and makes them victims of abuse.","Vebego Group

And therefore, the projects will also accord the neighbouring community bordering the area to have access to clean and potable water.",CAPRE Foundation,Africa,"From the ward consultations, almost every village has an issue with access to adequate and clean
drinking water as well as access to electricity supply. In terms of access to water, either they are
using water from open wells; hand pumps that are barely functional; boreholes with inadequate
tank and solar panel capacities to serve their needs, and cant be connected to NAWEC due distance . Similarly,
they do not have adequate water to provide for the needs of their cattle, in areas with large cattle
concentration. Water is a basic need, and thus strategies need to be put in place to see how best to
relief this major burden on the people by improving access to clean drinking water through
provision of new borehole systems, rehabilitation and expansion of existing borehole systems, and
extension of water mains in key streets of major settlements. Cattle drinking points should be
provided where necessary.
➢ Provide borehole systems to communities using open wells
➢ Expand borehole systems for communities with inadequate capacity, especially boreholes
serving two or more communities
➢ Provide cattle drinking points for clusters of communities with a large cattle population
➢ Support extension of pipe-borne water to under-served urban settlements
 The Council will ensure that the immediate priorities of the council and its citizens
are acted upon in a timely and coordinated manner. Each priority is accompanied by a listing of
priority actions that form the basis for the Results Framework. While some activities will be
implemented by the council, the execution of others will have to be done by relevant partners, all
under the overall supervision and coordination of the council. The council should have in place
the means of ensuring proper and effective implementation, coordination, monitoring and
evaluation of the plan.
Similarly, NGOs that are engaged in the relevant aspects of the plan, as well as the communities
themselves, will be engaged to contribute in the realization of these priority objectives. Also, the
engagement of the private sector will be sought on possible joint venture initiatives like public
private partnerships as well as through offering certain incentives where feasible and appropriate,
to encourage them to invest in the region for wealth and job creation.
Also, while the involvement of bilateral and multi-lateral development partners tend to focus more
at the national level, the council will actively seek to engage them on how best they could support
activities that are in line with their respective mandates and engagement with the country. This is
particularly relevant, as these donors have organized their activities around the National
Development Plan and that they have a stake in a fully functioning local government system that
is responsive to local needs.
Finally, the active consultation and engagement of communities and citizens must be pursued as
part of this collaborative partnership-building process. Citizens need to be consulted in the
identification of the council priorities; engaged to actively participate in the execution of
programmes where necessary; and regularly apprised of ongoing developments at the council.","The council to that cognizant of the fact that the implementation of SDG suffered some setbacks most particularly in the under-developing world. this is attributed to a series of factors ranging from, inequalities, inadequate smart technological infrastructure, minimal or untapped multi-stakeholder partnerships and capacity gaps. The council identified some of these challenges through multiple stakeholders' engagement both at the regional, national and international levels, thus, enabling us to craft a candid result oriented approach.
As evident, Local community participation in water and sanitation management has the potential to yield benefits such as the empowerment of marginalized groups and sustainable service delivery. However, the current indicator monitors the existence of policies and procedures for local community participation and not whether this participation is genuine and meaningful. Further research is required to understand the complexities of participation and its impact, to ensure that policies are effective and sustainable. Furthermore, Good water governance provides the political, institutional and administrative rules, practices and processes for taking decisions and implementing them. It is key to implementing integrated water resources management, which aims to coordinate between sectors to overcome a siloed approach. An improved enabling environment for investment will create the necessary impetus for private sector investment that will boost progress on SDG 6. Implementing IWRM at the transboundary level is further evidence and recognition of the critical need to strengthen cooperation over shared water resources and the benefits they provide, which can prevent conflicts.
The formulation of this action was primarily informed by local community people through a candid result oriented interaction with the council. The interactions were centred on identifying challenges and articulating solutions thereby ensuring collective participation in the implementation with an aim to bridge the gap and ensure community ownership. Another means for the action to accelerate the SDG implementation is the framework approach the action aims to take. The Council as a public institution considerably factored the prevailing inequality and thus, required us to formulate policies that are all-inclusive and participatory.
A solid and workable strategic plan requires opening the lines of communication by
involving the relevant parties that have a stake in the activities of the council: support staff,
managers, directors, councillors and citizens. Without everyone on board from the beginning, the
likelihood of facing challenges and/or failure in implementation becomes high. While this is true
during the plan formulation process, communication has to be a continuous process.
Everyone needs to understand how they fit into this action, and making the plan readily accessible to stakeholders, acts as an
additional motivator and a source of accountability.
Effective communication ensures not only transparency and accountability in the council’s
operations but also builds confidence and trust with its partners. The council should therefore
make use of all available channels of communication, including developing a website, radio talk
shows, and social media to provide the framework for internal and external communication, aimed
at improving its visibility and fostering support among external partners. This we hope will address the interlinkages, and accelerate SDG implementation.","The Strategic Plan defines the strategic priorities that the council sets to achieve within the plan
period in fulfilment of the aspirations of its people. While the primary responsibility for the
realization of these objectives lies with the council, it is evident that BAC alone cannot do it given
its limited financial, human and material resources base. It is therefore important that the council
seeks beneficial partnerships in this journey. The council has collaborated with some institutions implementing such as ""SEN DE GEL"" and ""GAMWOL"". Still, it intends to partner with more institutions and philanthropies in the area of the provision of safe drinking water to people in both rural and urban settlement within the jurisdiction of west coast region.",Goal 6,6.b,"Sun, 01/01/2023 - 12:00","Thu, 01/01/2026 - 12:00",,0.125,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.125,0.0,0.0

The drinking water coverage rate increased from 51% to 61% between 2010-2017 (UNICEF/WHO, JMP 2019) and varies depending on the environment. Indeed, in urban areas, this rate improved significantly, going from 82% to 90% between 2010 and 2017, an increase of 8 percentage points. Similarly, in rural areas, this rate increased from 48% to 57% over the same period, an increase of 9 percentage points. With regard to basic sanitation, access rates to adequate sanitation facilities increased from 45% to 46% between 2000 and 2017. The results of JMP show that 80% of households nationwide have access to an improved water source for drinking, but only 61% of them benefit from such a source. The DHS also reveals that in urban areas, a majority of households (42.6%) have access to water on site compared to 1.2% of rural households, which explains shorter water supply times. . This same survey illustrates that 76.6% of the richest households take less than 30 minutes to get a water supply compared to 48.8% for the poorest households. It also shows strong inequalities between the provinces with percentages ranging from 33.8% in Muyinga to 91% in Bujumbura. Access to water remains a challenge for some, depending on the province or the economic conditions of the household. The problem of drinking water also exists in schools. Only 3,205 out of 5,629 schools have water facilities according to the February 2018 report on the diagnosis of infrastructure and equipment in schools, established by the Ministry of Education, Higher Education and Scientific Research. According to the same report, water is present permanently throughout the year in only 45.46% of these schools. Our project aims to promote hand hygiene and menstrual hygiene while implementing improved sources and latrines close to households, to fully understand the purpose of the project, training will be organized for women in VSLAs and health workers for the change of mentality and this will help in responsible protection after the establishment of latrines and improved sources. After the installation of the latrines, the waste from the latter will be used as sources of income because they will be recycled to produce manure to be used by the direct beneficiaries and for sale to beneficiaries. ISOKO project will build 60 latrines and 60 springs in each municipality chosen at a distance of 5km from one spring to another. After noting that some residents travel more than 20 km in search of water, we chose to reduce the distance traveled to get drinking water. 10 community health workers will be chosen by CDS for the purpose of being trained and they will be actors of change for the whole community. Young teenagers from SDG clubs will have specific training on menstrual and hand hygiene and in return, they will share their knowledge with teenagers of the same generation.","The initiative mainly contributes to SDG 6: Guaranteeing access to water and sanitation for all and ensuring effective management of sustainable water resources"". Working in a potential area where there is water availability, it will contribute to the achievement of this objective by facilitating access for rural populations to drinking water and the protection of water resources. In order to ensure the sustainability, the initiative will promote the leadership of beneficiaries in ensuring each community has a focal point beneficiary-manager. This water action also contributes to the SDG n° 3: “Enable everyone to live in good health and promote the well-being of all"". Access to drinking water will help improving community health and well-being; It will contribute to SDG 8: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all. Burundi is listed among 46 Least Developed Countries, so this action will support sustaining per capita economic growth in accordance with national circumstances and, in particular, at least augment gross domestic product growth per annum in Burundi.

This web tool is available free of charge at https://water4allSDGs.org.
 It can be easily and quickly used by anybody in any country without having to know the details of the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda. Some use it during the design period of the project/policy, others during the construction period and others after its completion.
Most existing SDG tools only use indicators, which is useful to assess the overall progress of an area or a country towards the SDGs, but water people had no easy tool to detect all the impacts of a project on the SDGs in a way that respects the systemic value of the 2030 Agenda.  The Water4allSDGs© application fills this gap between the 2030 Agenda and the operational life of water entities. It detects impacts on targets of all the 17 SDGs and makes the negative contributions to their achievement as visible as the positive contributions.
The detailed methodology is available on the website in full transparency. It was developed by taking advantage of the expertise in all water domains of the FWP membership. It is enriched on a continuous basis following suggestions by users.","The use of Water4allSDGs makes SDG targets concrete and operational.
After having used it, most users have a new perception of SDGs.
• Users understand that SDGs are not imprecise domains of action but precise results to be obtained simultaneously. Acting for water is not sufficient to create progress towards SDG targets. This understanding helps them to avoid the trap of SDG-washing.
• Most users discover that an action related to water has many more impacts on SDGs than on SDG6 only.
• They also understand that some of these impacts may be negative, which helps them to facilitate dialogues and improve their projects/policies.
• As the interlinkages between SDGs are embedded in the application, users experience concretely the systemic value of the 2030 Agenda.
Then the use of Water4allSDGs may help all project and policy owners to better direct their activities towards the achievement of some SDG targets without compromising the achievement of other SDG targets.
If used by many project and policy owners, it is expected that global progress towards the achievement of the SDGs will be accelerated.
A reduction of the number of speeches and documents practicing SDG-washing is also expected.","Financing : French Water Basin Agencies and General Commissioner for Sustainable Development

All the Kukama women in the Peruvian Amazon",Peru,Latin America and the Caribbean,"Given our prolonged interrelation with the floodplain forest ecosystems, typical of the lower basin of the Marañón River, and our adaptation and coexistence with them, for the Kukama people the territory and the rivers constitute a whole. According to our worldview, rivers are sacred, as we consider them to be living beings that have a spirit. In 2021 we filed a constitutional lawsuit to urge Peru to recognize the Marañón River as a living being and as a subject of rights and, consequently, to recognize its fundamental rights, designating Huaynakana as legal guardian of the Marañón River - being empowered to represent its interests. We are currently leading a project called ""Without the river, there is no forest: Kukama women in defense of the Marañón River and its integral territory"". This project will enable Kukama women to strengthen their capacities in the defense of the river, giving value to their saberes (knowledges) and sentires (feelings/emotions), as well as their everyday life experiences. Through foregrounding their knowledge and worldview, this project will enhance Kukama women's agency in defending the river by promoting the conservation and sustainable use and management of the wetlands that conform Marañón River. Huaynakana's base communities are located within the Pacaya Samiria National Reserve (2,080,000 ha; designated a Ramsar site in 1986), and in its buffer zone. Pacaya Samiria houses an extensive area of floodplain forest ecosystems of immeasurable value to the planet.
On September 16, a major oil spill polluted the Marañón River with no concrete action from the Peruvian Government to help our communities. To this date, Huaynakana's base communities remain dealing with contaminated water, being this our only source of consumption and for conducting our everyday life activities. Women in our communities are disproportionally affected, which is something systemically overlooked and that Huaynakana wants to make visible. Given this, we have filed another constitutional lawsuit demanding the local/regional/national authorities to provide drinking water (clean & safe) and sanitation to the 29 Huaynakana's base communities.
Finally, we are working together with our partners to implement other initiatives that are directed and sum up to the defense and protection of the Marañón River, its tributaries, its ecosystems, and the Kukama people living within it.","Succeeding in the recognition of the Marañón River as a subject of rights will set a precedent for the advancement of the rights of nature and the rights of the rivers in Peru, Latin America, and abroad. This achievement would guarantee the protection of a major freshwater ecosystem in the Andes Amazon that is home to more than 2,400 known species of freshwater fish, nearly half of which are endemic. The Amazon Basin, of which the Marañón River is the main tributary, supports more than a dozen of Indigenous Peoples, and hundreds of communities whose livelihoods and culture depend on the river and its related ecosystems and where local populations consume up to 500g of fish a day, and that the river, therefore, plays a vital role in terms of food security and the health of the local population. Additionally, Huaynakana's lawsuit urging the Peruvian government to implement drinking water and sanitation in the 29 communities of the Parinari district in Loreto could accelerate the slow response of Peru in achieving the SDG 6, and could potentially set a precedent on how to respond to the larger necessity of providing clean & safe water & sanitation for all the Amazonian communities, paying attention to women's needs in particular.","International Rivers

For this purpose, FAO provides technical support to create an enabling environment for the implementation of national drought plans, through the provision/application of tools and methodologies, facilitation of peer-to-peer learning and information sharing, empowered cooperation and partnership, the establishment of community-of-practices, policy alignment, and improved coordination, and better access to financing Integrated Drought Management. FAO works in partnership with relevant stakeholders, inter alia, the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, World Meteorological Organization, and the Integrated Drought Management Programme to further mobilize resources and take policies into actions. The overall objective is to assist countries in translating drought plans into tangible measures on the field, thus mitigating drought risk and enhancing the resilience of vulnerable communities and ecosystems.  
To build resilience in the varying contexts of drought-prone areas, FAO provides resources through the following approaches and mechanisms: 
Piloting and showcasing field-tested solutions, digital toolkits, and methodologies along the three pillars of integrated drought management; 
Supporting resource mobilization and effective financing by diversified sources; 
Facilitating capacity-building, co-learning, and awareness-raising through innovative learning products and thematic events.  
Accessing and increasing the effectiveness of financing is a fundamental pre-condition of the implementation of drought plans. Therefore, FAO aims to create a global, collaborative platform for continued coordination of Integrated Drought Management, including sustainable drought financing. The platform is set to track the deployed financing for integrated drought management in member countries, provide guidelines for socially and environmentally acceptable financing, conduct country- and context-specific analysis of the business environment, collect business cases for bankable projects, and organize multi-stakeholder dialogues for facilitated private sector inclusion.","The benefits of Integrated Drought Management cut across multiple SDGs. Drought is amongst the most devastating climate-related hazards, and its impacts are expected to be further accelerated by climate change. Promoting proactive approaches in drought management will help mitigate and adapt to the impacts, including those on agriculture (SDG 13). Agriculture, being the largest water user in most developing countries, must be supported in the pursuit of transformational changes toward sustainable natural resources management, including land and water resources. Successful strategies of integrated drought management, by definition, depend on sustainable and efficient water management that ensures sufficient water availability for all demands and does not compromise future needs. Thus, integrated drought management interacts with and guides water sector planning (SDG 6). Equally important, drought-smart land management contributes to the resilience of agricultural systems and ecosystems, and vice versa (SDG 15). In turn, integrated and sustainable land and water management is a foundation for drought-resilient and productive agriculture sector that is essential to eliminate hunger, reduce poverty, and absorb labour force (SDG 2). Nevertheless, drought management is a multidisciplinary, multi-sectoral and multi-scale phenomenon, requiring the collaboration of a wide range of stakeholders. Given the large-scale and systematic impacts of drought events, drought risk management and resilience-building call for a substantially larger and diversified pool of financial resources, including domestic and private sectors. Therefore, integrated drought management as a common objective accelerates the establishment of functional partnerships (SDG 17).","Member countries, UNCCD, specialized agencies and NGOs, international and national financial institutions, private sector","Goal 2, Goal 6, Goal 13, Goal 15, Goal 17",,"Fri, 01/01/2021 - 12:00","Wed, 12/31/2025 - 12:00",,0.0,0.3333333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6043956043956067

It is with this aim in mind that Veolia sets itself the task of “Resourcing the world” through its environmental services business.
Our activities directly impact 13 SDGs, whose challenges are linked to Veolia’s Purpose, and we are actively working to take up the challenges relating to the preservation of resources and social issues.
To do so, Veolia implements a multifaceted performance: we are determined to achieve the same level of consideration and expectations regarding economic, commercial, social, environmental, and human resources performance in every action and decision that we take. To reach this ambition, Veolia gave itself 18 objectives, assessed by KPIs and targets covering all these aspects. These objectives and KPIs measure our progression and are publically reported on an annual basis. Each member of Veolia’s Executive Committee sponsors at least one of the objectives and is responsible for the target achievement. 
Among our 18 multifaceted objectives, two are directly linked water issues:
1. Veolia is committed to promoting better access to water and sanitation services. The Group develops and implements adapted solutions in developing countries but also deploys assistance measures for the most fragile people and communities away from these services everywhere in the world. Veolia works with delegating authorities as well as with partners and industrial clients to provide long-term access to essential services and develop locally inclusive measures to leave no one behind: social tariffs, assistance solutions to respond to consumers’ financial difficulties, or decentralized solutions to promote access to water.
As a leading company in the water sector, Veolia also advocates making the right to water and sanitation a priority and supports the adoption of Human Rights to Water and Sanitation in National legislation.
2. Veolia is committed to combating pollution and accelerating ecological transformation by reducing losses from water networks.
In the face of increasing pressure on water resources leading to scarcity and a deterioration in quality, the Group has made sustainable management of water resources one of its priorities. We defined a target to improve the efficiency of the municipal drinking water distribution networks we operate. By reducing water loss through improvement of the distribution network efficiency, we optimize the management of resources to preserve them, mainly in regions facing water scarcity.
The Group is also taking concrete actions to provide alternative water resources in areas affected by water scarcity. Veolia embraces a holistic approach taking into account the effects of climate change on existing water infrastructures, the people who operate them, and the population benefiting from them.","At Veolia we are a major contributor to all SDGs where water is concerned.  As an urban services provider, Veolia plays a key role in managing essential services in water and sanitation (SDG 11). We provide innovative solutions to doing more with fewer resources (SDG9).
By making access to essential services a priority of our strategy and developing a better access to clean water or sanitation services to vulnerable people and communities and fixing a target of access to 9 Million habitants included in its next long term incentive program 2025, Veolia contributes to improving public health (SDG3), as well as reducing inequalities (SDG10).
The Group is committed to gender equality and acts to increase the number of women in its businesses and strengthen the percentage of women managers (SDG 5). Veolia supports sustainable growth by promoting decent working conditions for all, in compliance with human rights and the rights of its employees, subcontractors and suppliers (SDG 8).
Through its mitigation and adaptation solutions, Veolia contributes directly to meeting climate and ecosystem conservation challenges (SDG 13, SDG 14 and SDG 15). Veolia is making a strong advocacy on reuse water based on its strong experience around the world (Namibia, USA, Spain, Jordan...) and globally transforming a water treatment plant in a “biofactory” as it is the case in Chile for example. In France we decided to lead by example and to implement units to make all treatments self-sufficient in water to protect the resources of water in line with scarcity scénario.
Veolia is a local operator and interacts with all its stakeholders, to build together solutions adapted to local challenges. We develop alliances with other players to meet the needs of the public covered by the SDGs. By developing new partnerships and notably by calling on additional expertise contributed by its partners and shared value creation, Veolia contributes to strengthening SDG implementation resources (SDG17).","Veolia  partners with municipalities and industries of all sizes on all continents, under their sovereign control and with strict accountability and transparency settings

Water demand has increased sharply in many regions of the world as a result of population growth and economic expansion. Water supply is becoming more unreliable in many regions of the world because of climate change, which is also altering the timing of water availability and increasing the severity of drought and flood events. The discharge of untreated municipal, industrial, and agricultural wastewater into rivers and lakes is rendering much of our surface water and groundwater unusable. These increasing pressures on water resources are undermining water security, and contributing to conflicts over water, in many parts of the developing world.
At the UN 2023 Water Conference, the Water, Peace, and Security (WPS) Partnership’s implementing partners commit to work with governments, NGOs, donors and investors to significantly increase the scope and scale of our initiative (2020 to 2024), for reversing the vicious cycle of water conflicts, into a virtuous cycle of water cooperation and mutual benefits:
-	Target: Governments, NGOs, private sector, donors and investors in participating countries must commit to the goals of SDG 6 – ensuring the accessibility and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all.
-	Prioritize: Governments, NGOs, private sector, donors, and investors must use advanced approaches and methods to assess water-related conflict risks and identify and prioritize interventions to foster cooperation and peace.
-	Incentivize: Governments – with inclusive stakeholder participation – need to develop policies, plans, and incentives to transform water conflicts into cooperative opportunities, paving the way for sustainable development of societies.
The WPS partnership and implementing partners commit to:
-	Build: Our coalition will build the capacity of government entities, investors, NGOs, and local communities to assess water-related security risks and implement measures to change vicious cycles of water and conflict into virtuous cycles of water and peace.
-	Monitor: Our coalition will help governments and other stakeholders develop monitoring, evaluation, and learning (MEL) systems to track the implementation of agreed-upon interventions and the health of freshwater systems they are designed to support. 
The WPS uses global tools (data and models) to predict likelihood of water related conflicts, before zooming into specific regions. Presently, WPS with the support of the Netherlands Government, and GIZ,  is successfully implementing its innovative approach (Understand, Mobilize, Learn, Dialogue), in four regions: Mali, Iraq, Kenya, Ethiopia.","The growing water crisis poses a threat to livelihoods, ecosystems and security. In response to these threats, the Water, Peace and Security (WPS) partnership was founded in 2018 to develop innovative tools and services that help local stakeholders identify, understand and address water-related security risks. We use cutting-edge technology to increase awareness and understanding. This knowledge is used in participatory analysis, capacity building and awareness raising activities to support timely, informed and inclusive action in regions prone to water-related insecurity, such as currently Mali, Iraq, Ethiopia and Kenya. We believe this action, based on regional needs, is required to prevent escalation of water-related tensions into conflict. In fact, it can even enhance collaboration among stakeholders, turning water related threats into water related opportunities for peacebuilding.","The Water, Peace and Security (WPS) partnership is a collaboration between the Netherlands Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ) and a consortium of six partners: IHE Delft (lead partner), World Resources Institute (WRI), Deltares, The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies (HCSS), Wetlands International and International Alert.

Without effective engagement with the private sector, it will be difficult for countries to contribute to meeting SDG 6. TOWSI accelerates watershed-based outcomes by providing industrial water users with an international best practice framework to assess water uses, impacts and risks so that companies better understand their water challenges and opportunities. Once the risk assessment phase is completed, TOWSI connects water users with water technology solutions to help them mitigate water quality and quantity related risks. 
The Water Council will draw on its network of 150 members and strategic partners to engage industrial water users in the use of the assessment framework. Once companies sign up for use of the framework they will be encouraged to utilize the WAVE: Water Stewardship Verified protocol to develop a strategic roadmap of water-related actions to take across their enterprise. WAVE requires that companies seek independent verification to the protocol so stakeholders will have assurances that the water-related actions taken by companies are credible and responsive to material risks. Once industrial water users understand their water risks and watershed challenges, The Water Council will work with them to implement best practices and utilize appropriate water innovations and technologies. The Water Council is continuously identifying and deploying new water technologies through its post-accelerator, pilot and tech challenge programs. The Water Council will follow-up with annual check-ins on TOWSI participants over an initial two-year period.
TOWSI is the only program of its kind globally that connects water stewardship with water technology in a single engagement to ensure that water users do the right things, at the right times and places when it comes to improving water stewardship outcomes both inside and outside the fence line. TOWSI accelerates meeting SDG 6 as it will be implemented by The Water Council in partnership with key stakeholders that constitute its North American water innovation, technology and stewardship ecosystem.","The water use, impact and assessment framework will accelerate company understanding and action as it relates to improving water stewardship outcomes within direct operations and supply chains. TOWSI will seek to connect water users in shared watersheds that have similar water challenges and opportunities. Impacts of the assessment framework and target setting are expected to improve water stewardship outcomes where companies operate: good water quality, sustainable water balance, healthy status of important water-related areas, good water governance and safe, secure access to water for sanitation and hygiene (WASH). These outcomes will occur both within the fence line and outside the fence line: improved operational efficiencies, beyond regulatory compliance inside; and, improved water availability, quality and WASH for all within the watershed. Collective action with active private sector participation is the key to accelerate SDG 6 implementation.
The TOWSI assessment framework will also help inform industrial water users on how their operations and sourcing interact with local energy and food challenges thereby creating a credible connection to addressing SDG 7, 9, 12 and 13. In addition to the water-energy-food-nexus, we know that most people will feel the impacts of climate changes through their relationship and/or proximity to water. In fact, many industrial companies are already struggling with climate-related water resources impacts right now including drought, intense storms, poor water quality, all of which impact direct operations and supply chain resilience. TOWSI develops the knowledge base on which companies can launch a climate-informed water strategy and ensure appropriate linkages are made with other material issues like energy and food production, as relevant. A comprehensive corporate sustainability strategy must include water and TOWSI is the platform on which to build and incorporate water into company actions.",The Water Council's 150 members and current roster of strategic partners.,"Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 9, Goal 12, Goal 13","6.3, 6.4, 6.b , 7.3, 9.4, 12.2, 12.4, 12.6, 13.1, 13.3","Wed, 03/22/2023 - 12:00","Sat, 03/01/2025 - 12:00",https://stewardship.thewatercouncil.com/,0.375,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.16483516483516544

Supporting governments of the Sanitation and Water for All Partnership Priority Countries and others to access for all: Establishing new or working through existing national, local and regional multi-stakeholder partnerships to support leaders in these countries to rapidly scale up progress to achieve SDGs 6.1 and 6.2. Action will be focused through the five GAF accelerators. 2. Supporting the UN OCHCR to promote a human rights-based agenda: Strengthening private operator input on implementation of the human right to water and sanitation, in relevant institutional discussions at the UN, in international forums and on the ground, to support the UN OCHCR. This Commitment recognises that the 2030 agenda requires a massive deployment of resources and private water operators and public-private partnerships are a tool for governments seeking to achieve the SDG agenda. AquaFed, since 2006, has been one of the most engaged promotors of the human rights to safe drinking water and sanitation, throughout the cycles at the Human Rights Council and working with the offices of C. de Albuquerque, L. Heller and P. Arrojo. AquaFed and its members have been key contributors to ALL the reports that the HRC and OHCHR have commissioned, including a landmark report recognising the validity of the option of using Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) and the private sector to deliver good quality public services. Doing so, in a broad coalition with non-state and STATE actors, has led to the recognition of the RTW and the RTS in the last 10 years. AquaFed has always been advocating for integration of the human rights agenda into the SDG framework. We believe robust governance is essential for the fulfilment of human rights. Robust governance promotes the inclusion of all people in decision-making and implementation of WASH services. It also promotes the inclusion of financial institutions, the private sector, civil society and the most water-intensive sectors, such as energy, agriculture and industry, in the development of local projects and policies. AquaFed’s members, private companies, are quite unique representatives from a business perspective. Our Members’ daily job is to implement the HRTWS. We will continue in the next decade to make sure this very valid option for governments to implement their public policies through PPP contracts is well understood and appropriately governed. GOVERNANCE: Our progress on the first objective will be measured directly through the SWA’s Mutual Accountability Mechanism. The second will be measured through subsequent collaboration work directly with UN OCHCR colleagues and the UN Water Roadmap on human rights to water and sanitation.","If successful, the impacts will first be felt at institutional level first rather than on the ground, but we expect the benefits to flow into service delivery after 12-18 months. Objective 1 We expect that private operators, whether local or international, will be an established partner in multi-stakeholder process on water and sanitation. This means policymakers and public authorities will be able to benefit from private water operator expertise. As well as technical support and assistance, the operators should be able to have helped create an enabling environment for private operators and private companies to be included in WASH service planning and delivery. Another impact we hope to see quite quickly is better engagement between stakeholders in the countries, at least first at national level. This could and should quite quickly translate into more efficient and joined-up service delivery. Other positive impacts could be: • More efficient utilities • Greater focus on youth skills, training and development and overall capacity building • Stronger leadership from public authorities Objective 2 The expected impacts are set out more clearly in the UN Water roadmap. These are: 1. More and better multi-stakeholder engagement, advocacy and dialogues on HRWS 2. Strengthening of the alignment of UN-Water’s work with human rights framework 3.

We are working towards the achievement of Goal 6 (""Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all"") of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. To achieve this critical objective we: i. Engage in advocacy at both policy and decentralised levels to strengthen and deepen our role in influencing policies and practices that impede access to safe water, sanitation and hygiene by the people in rural communities. ii. Develop the capacity of relevant stakeholders and rural communities members, equip them with the right knowledge for best practices in the water and sanitation sector, and establish mechanisms for ensuring government spending accountability. iii.

The WISE Scales have been established as reliable, equivalent and valid in more than 60 countries. This open-access survey has been translated into dozens of languages (https://www.ipr.northwestern.edu/wise-scales/measure-water-insecurity/i…). The data that the scales generate can be used to understand prevalence, measure impact, and hold stakeholders accountable.

We are good at quantifying the supply-side indicators of water (physical water availability, infrastructure), but less good at quantifying the user/consumer side. Data generated by the Water Insecurity Experiences Scales (www.hwise.org) has accelerated our ability to identify disparities in water security by gender, age, urbanicity and other individual level characteristics (cf. Lancet Global Health, https://doi.org/10.1016/S2542-5196(22)00241-8). In a 25-country study with FAO in the Bulletin of the WHO, we demonstrated remarkably strong relationships between water insecurity and food insecurity, thereby also demonstrating how these data can bridge sectors (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9874369/pdf/BLT.22.288771…).","The WISE scales were built with the help of more than 50 scholars and practitioners across many disciplines, institutions, and time zones.

            € Investments in sanitation by households","Rural and per urban population spread across the six countries including women, children, youth, adolescent girls, elderlies, marginal and socially excluded groups.
FINISH Mondial has reach out to more than 8 million people.","Bangladesh, Ethiopia, India, Kenya, Global Action Plan, Uganda","Africa, Asia and Pacific","The FINISH Mondial programme envisions a world in which people have access to safely managed sanitation and are financially included.
FINISH Mondial works through the Diamond model-approach which is proven for local sanitation market development. It constitutes four key pillars: communities, financiers, government and businesses. It is a multi-stakeholder approach to build local sustainable systems for the construction of improved (SDG6-proof) sanitation systems. Until to date, FINISH has been able to facilitate over 1,5 million safely managed toilets reaching nearly 8 million people, generating 16 million workdays for local entrepreneurs. Over € 280 million have been invested by consumers and financial institutions in sanitation. FINISH also contributes to climate change mitigation by treatment of 41,860 tons of solid waste and 16,830 tons of fecal sludge and saving 5,800 ton of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. 
Through the circular sanitation economy model, we contribute to climate change mitigation and adaption and the SDGs. FINISH Mondial facilitates access to safely managed sanitation facilities at the household level, guaranteeing that facilities are safely managed. The entire sanitation service and value chain is considered from containment to collection to treatment and reuse. FINISH Mondial takes the sanitation chain a step further towards a circular sanitation economy in which toilet resources (human waste) feed into a system which replaces traditional waste management with a circular economy approach. 
Although FINISH Mondial is based on field experiences and studies of multiple years of engagement, learning is at the heart of the programme. The internal learning has been very strong. The FINISH Mondial teams have (acquired) the capability and capacity to adopt to new circumstances, and identify opportunities for expansion, innovation and new partnerships locally. In the 6-country FM programme, learning becomes more complex and also offers new opportunities. Good quality monitoring, evaluation and learning (MEL) are key to this. The monitoring and evaluation (M&E) process is guided by the MEAL working group which includes dedicated M&E staff in the countries. Derived from the Theory of Change, the MEAL working group has compiled a monitoring and evaluation framework. The framework is supported by indicators on impact, outcome and output level including the frequency and methodology of data collection. Next to baseline and end line studies, midterm and end term evolutions, monthly reporting schedules emphasis is placed on digital data collection and analysis. 
Governance Structure:
The Supervisory Board includes a representation of the partner organisations WASTE, Amref Flying Doctors and Aqua for All on executive level and two independent advisors with a background in development and finance, the chair is independent. The Management Team is led by an executive team of Chief Executive Officer, Chief Operational Officer and Chief Financial Officer and includes representatives of the main partner organisations WASTE, Amref Flying Doctors, Aqua for All, Amref Health Africa and FINISH Society. A similar governance structure has been set up in the six countries with an independent country coordinator as secretary of the local supervisory/advisory board and head of the management team.","Impact: FINISH Mondial aims to contribute to healthier and economically empowered communities.

Factoring indigenous knowledge
1.  create a community of practice (CoP) to collect indigenous knowledge in water conservation alternatives
2. organize knowledge transfer sessions with the CoP to transfer water management know-how to members of the community;
3. focus on sustainable water manage practices such as rainwater collection and treatment, and preservation of water catchment areas in order to ensure long-term availability of groundwater for the facility.","Expected impact:
With this project the following impact will be felt by the community in the long-term:
1. The long-term water security of the community in general will improve and the water stress experienced by aquifer will be drastically reduced
2. School enrolment will increase. The graduation rate per year will increase as direct result of an improvement in performance marked mainly by positive changes in basic skills such as Reading, Writing and Mathematics;
3. School dropout rates especially for the girls will reduce. Girls will go on to complete school thereby avoidance early pregnancy and marriages that often times see them becoming single moms. This situation will restore a much better quality of life and a stronger prospect of a better career path. Educated moms will bring up healthier and balanced kids who will in turn go on to be successful. The multiplier effects will continue to the next generation of kids who become part of the family.
4. The women who access the water points will spend more time in the farm producing food for their children. They will not have to travel very long distances to fetch water in order to cook food. The average family spends about 2-4 hours trekking to sources of safe drinking water. This time will be better spent cooking or on the farms which will raise the nutritional status of the young ones
5. There will be a significant drop in the incidence of water-borned diseases as a result of these facilities. Healthier and richer families will result and the saved cash can be used to meet other needs such as pay rents, buy food and clothing and attend to other social challenges needed for Cameroon to meet her SDGs.
6 Preservation of water catchment or recharge areas and the harvesting and treatment of rainwater presents and adaptation opportunity that will enable the communities to be less vulnerable to effects of climate change on water scarcity. This means the communities over time will build much needed climate change resilience and adaptive capacity that are needed for them to cope","Local Councils and Councillors;

            For the first project phase, PHAAE has access to data from Abuja Municipal Area Council (AMAC) and has scaled over 50 schools in rural areas which will have a direct WASH impact on these communities with access to groundwater.
      
      
,","PHAAE is working to close inequality gaps in WASH in Nigeria, Sub-Saharan Africa and other African countries. We aim to achieve our mission by building partnerships with governments, philanthropy organizations and international non-government organizations.",Nigeria,Africa,"Climate change impacts are felt through water - floods, rising sea levels, shrinking ice fields, wildfires and droughts. With the demand for freshwater projected to grow by more than 40 per cent by 2050, water scarcity is an enormous concern. However, water can fight climate change. Sustainable water management is central to building the resilience of societies and ecosystems. Most African countries have sufficient groundwater for people to survive and thrive – in some cases, for more than 50 years.

The world's neglected defence against climate change emphasizes increasing water and sanitation financing for marginalized communities through a fixed percentage of annual government budgets and increased international donor and private sector investment. In rural communities of Nigeria, the usual water source in villages is the nearby streams where the villagers usually fetch water. Sometimes these streams are far and take hours of journey to get the everyday water - it is usually women and children who have to do so. The streams have dirty and unsafe water not approved for drinking water standards. The use of wood to make a fire in boiling the water further leads to deforestation, which has been one of the major causes of biodiversity degradation in these areas. In doing so, it hinders the efforts of accessible education for children and youth and women empowerment.

Education on groundwater access and resources will defend against the water crisis by empowering women and children towards better lives and enhanced WASH conditions. PHAAE has been able to work on such grassroots water projects in Nigeria. The governmental institutions are not equipped and capable of reaching the marginalized communities in Nigeria. More funding and financing to the NGOs will help bring clean water access to schools in these communities in western Africa and act as a catalyst in other parts of the continent.

PHAAE has worked closely on grassroots transformational projects in marginalized and rural communities. Since urban communities don't have many water-related issues, our main targets are schools in villages with no access to clean and safe water. It is usually villages with no basic water, sanitation and hygiene infrastructure.","PHAAE aims to lead a grassroots transformation that enables self-sustaining health practices with access to inclusive water, sanitation and hygiene for women and children in rural communities of Africa. Millions in Africa have no access to enough clean water to drink.

Recent research debunks the myth that the continent is running out of water. There are vast water reserves under people's feet, many of which are replenished yearly by rainfall and other surface water. Still, they cannot be accessed because of the chronically underfunded services. Tapping into groundwater would ensure millions have access to safe and clean water even with the uncertainty of the climate crisis.

PHAAE, in the past, has delivered successful drilling projects providing clean groundwater access to marginalized communities. With international funding, we were able to install hand pumps that were more sustainable than tubewell, which uses unaffordable fuel pumping generators. The solar panels to support the pumping generators are sustainable but require expensive and high maintenance, which makes it non-inclusive for the rural population.

According to our expert analysis - our groundwater access for WASH projects in the village schools directly impact 200-400 people and indirectly 1000-2000 families in every community since the women and children don't have to travel long distances to the streams to fetch dirty and unsafe water. The whole community fetches water from the handpumps installed in the schools since schools are not fenced and are usually central to these villages and communities.","UN Volunteers, Global Handwashing Partnership and WASH United.","Goal 3, Goal 4, Goal 6, Goal 13, Goal 15","3.9, 3.d, 4.5, 6.1 , 6.2, 6.4, 6.5, 6.a, 6.b , 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.a, 13.b, 15.1, 15.5",,,"PHAAE aims to tackle health-related inequalities and poverty in Nigeria with a solution-oriented approach to water, sanitation and hygiene issues.

More than 60% of global population growth between 2008 and 2100 will take place in sub-Saharan Africa (32%) and South Asia (30%).
However, a critical situation (less than 500 m3 of water available/inhabitant/year) is already affecting several countries (Libia, Yemen, Egypt.), and the chronic shortage (less than 1,000 m3/inhabitant/year) is also affecting many areas. geographic (Bengladesh, Pakistan, India, Sudan....), while being a great challenge for others (example Central Asia). As populations grow, so do the needs to create more jobs, produce more food and more energy. They all depend to some extent on quantitatively and qualitatively limited water resources. Water is a game changer for food systems as enshrined in the UN Dialogue on 27.04.2021.
In addition, the centralized production of drinking water (400 billion m3) in the world mobilizes, for pumping and treatment, 1% of the electricity consumed on the planet (as much as the electricity consumption of Australia). Leaks on conventional supply networks represent more than 20% of the water mobilized in France and more than 50% in many countries, i.e. a waste of energy in the world estimated at 100 TWh per year (Altereo 2021) .

Therefore, it is necessary that the final recommendations of the Conference include not a hundred initiatives and prescriptions for all cases, but one reliable solution - Key Entry Point:
1) All we need the transition from decision-making systems divided by countries and sectors to holistic management, based on ecosystems of water basins, through strong and authorized basin councils.
This is both a condition and a basis for:
- integrating water and climate goals into economic strategies;
- engagement people and the private sector;
- for cross-border cooperation, and as well for
- research, education, standard and tariff solutions, technologies and others tools.
All these tasks and needs could be clarified and better solved only locally - within the framework of a inclusive and basin approach.
2) And from the global and national levels, they will only need political, legal and technical support.

Water is a common good that is essential for life and for socio-economic development. At the same time, it is a resource, a living environment, a vital element for climate regulation, ecosystem functioning and human development. France was a world pioneer in the establishment of governance based on hydrographic basins. However, the assumption that everything can be solved at this scale is being eroded. The global is catching up with the local and new questions are emerging. These challenges need to be addressed within the framework of integrated, systemic, multi-actor approaches to jointly develop solutions appropriate to contrasting realities. Over a 10-year period, this research programme aims to change the paradigm by replacing water as a common good, a central element of socio-hydrosystems subject to climatic and anthropogenic forcing to which urgent adaptation is required. The structure of the programme is based on six major scientific and technical challenges with major obstacles to knowledge to be overcome to ensure effective transfer to the various stakeholders. These challenges focus on: 1) Anticipating the evolution of the water resource to allow for adaptation; 2) Developing a “Water footprint” of environmental processes and anthropogenic activities; 3) Developing water as a sentinel for environmental and human health along the land-sea continuum; 4) Solutions to promote the adaptability and resilience of socio-hydrosystems; 5) Supporting the socio-ecological transition towards innovative water governance for sustainable and resilient societies; 6) Sharing water data for knowledge and action in a sustainable way.","Transformative, this programme will have direct and significant impacts on the development of societies and territories: • Socio-economic: support for actors in the transformation of their practices with innovative solutions, deployment of the circular economy. • Socio-cultural: evolution of practices through the integration of water values, develop integrated tools for the management of data and treatments for a holistic approach, priority of sectoral policies in the short, medium and long term. • Environmental: produce adaptation solutions, preserve biodiversity and aquatic ecosystems, and alert pollutions and risks to water resources. • Health and social: improve the quality of life and health of populations, access to quality water and sanitation. • Scientific: international recognition, support for socio-economic sectors and European actions, emergence of a virtual water data platform. • Education and Capacity Building: Educating a new generation of researchers on innovative and transformative concepts, moving to a virtual knowledge platform.","CNRS, INRAE, IRD, IFREMER, Météo France, Universities of Bordeaux, Grenoble – Alpes, Lyon1, Montpellier, Rennes 1, Strasbourg, Toulouse Midi-Pyrénées","Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 9, Goal 11, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 14, Goal 15, Goal 17","1.4, 2.4 , 3.3, 3.9, 5.4 , 6.1 , 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.b , 9.4, 11.1 , 11.5, 12.2, 13.1, 13.3, 14.1, 15.1, 15.5, 17.6, 17.8, 17.18","Wed, 03/01/2023 - 12:00",,soon available - website www.onewater.fr https://www.brgm.fr/en/programme/onewater-national-water-research-innovation-programme,0.625,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.125,1.0,0.05494505494505515

Singapore is also exploring the use of aerobic granular sludge membrane bioreactor and membrane aerated biofilm reactor to work towards energy self-sufficient used water treatment plants.) Singapore is currently constructing an integrated solid waste treatment and used water reclamation facility, known as the Tuas Nexus, that leverages synergies in water, energy recovery and material handling between the two plants. Co-location of the plants maximises energy and resource recovery, and optimises land use. By co-digesting food waste with used water sludge, Singapore is working towards an energy self-sufficient used water treatment facility, while also minimising solid waste for disposal at landfills. The novel technologies adopted at Tuas Nexus were researched and developed at demonstration plants before being implemented on a full scale.","Under SDG 6, PUB is leading research and development for the water sector in Singapore and has integrated various technologies at a system level to achieve the outcome of ensuring adequate access to water and sanitation. Water resource management has also been integrated with waste management in the example of the Tuas Nexus, where synergies have been identified to reduce waste products and increase energy production from biogas to reduce the facility’s overall carbon footprint. This in turn will help to achieve a more sustainable management and efficient use of natural resources, thus achieving the goals of SDG 12.

Through these technologies, customers are empowered to become smarter users of water by adopting water-saving behaviours and fixing leaks promptly to reduce water wastage. PUB will review the rollout of the first phase, build up its capabilities and expertise, and take into account advances in technology before implementing subsequent phases of the Smart Water Meter Programme.","Under SDG 6, this action will increase water-use efficiency as customers will have greater visibility of their daily water consumption.

We believe this approach stimulates outdoor learning for learners.

We strengthen partnerships with remote low-income countries’ schools all over the world and integrate learning the science of environmental stewardship, advancement of environmental and climate resilience: Green STEM, health & hygiene, technology and circularity with art expressions through their respective traditional community values, faith, cultural and socio-economic norms.

The program promotes positive behavioral change in schools, families and local communities to live a more sustainable life with less water and soil pollution and less plastic waste. Young learners acquire deeper understanding and connection with nature/biodiversity and it will inspire them to be advocates for conservation. SEEDS partners with global organizations that promote storytelling and human-centered approaches to young learners and deliver ESD in remote schools.

With water and climate education as the foundation, school children are encouraged to use this information to take action in their daily lives. We aid them to be advocates of watershed protection in their communities. It is critical to equally engage young people, the schools and the communities as stakeholders in preserving the ecosystem, development and sustainability as they are catalysts for awareness. This is a significant step to Water Action and establish an all inclusive key player in the society.","NOT ONE YOUNG PERSON SHOULD BE LEFT BEHIND: The amplification of the impact of SEEDS projects is guided by its mission to holistically equip the youth, their schools and the communities. The young learners are shared with the resource knowledge and good practice examples so then they can advocate for environment protection as well as practice sustainable living that doesn't harm the planet and promote health and development. It has to be highlighted that ‘the ones left behind’ such as vulnerable communities are prioritized.


Usually, indigenous communities, young refugee children and learners coming from poor communities lack representation and agency.


The human-centered approach in curriculum design and application encourages resilience through knowledge transfer in their local context. Added impact and benefits in terms of development program is ensuring alignment with SDG 6 throughout its implementation. Since the program is facilitated in schools, basic rights of a child are ensured through provision of safe water to drink, menstrual hygiene management and sanitation facilities are in focus.

The ESD curriculum co-created with schools and other stakeholders are imperative to achieve the deliverables. Storytelling for change is one way SEEDS aims to deliver the message of the totality of the program and invigorate young learners to bond with their peers and connect on the topics on environment, ecosystem protection among others. Kindling Smiles-Shaheed Haroon Academy and Rivers of Khmelnytskyi are strong amplifiers of knowledge and networks. In particular, SEEDS partnership with The Storytelling Project in many other future work assures shared goals are expanded and reproduced to more communities.

Methodology - Consolidating, developing and disseminating expertise on water law - international water law, transnational water law, national water law through world-recognised expertise in transboundary water cooperation. Focus on scholarship and practice on the ground. Building new communities of transboundary water cooperation with specific expertise and understanding of the integral role of water law in this field.","Enhanced understanding and expertise in international, transnational and national water law as applied to transboundary water cooperation. Integral to effective transboundary water cooperation are functional water law frameworks - that transcend the layers of water law - from international - transnational- national. Implementation occurs at the national level and the rules of international water law need to find meaningful expression at the national level through an integrated legal framework. Further operational institutional mechanisms that work within and beyond national borders to implement transboundary water cooperation requires a normative context that includes the broad range of stakeholders across the myriad layers that are involved in this matrix. SDG implementation, in the case of monitoring transboundary water cooperation asks riparian national States to report on the cooperative arrangements that apply to their transboundary basins - in many instances national governments do not appreciate the rules of law that apply both at the international but also at the national level - more accessible knowledge to water law can assist in this reporting. Interlinkages across layers of water law and governance needs more efforts and the International Water Law Academy is well-placed and keen to contribute to making this happen.","Global Affiliates of the International Water Law Academy - more than 50 international and national water law experts from around the world.

The situation is becoming even more challenging with the increasing population and urbanisation, unsustainable use of water and escalating impacts of the Climate Changes. The project addresses these challenges through a matrix of three vertical cross-disciplinary issues on health, climate change, and energy, and two horizontal topics: gender equality, and digitalisation of education. The project has evolved from NORHED I WaSo Africa. ESSENCE-Africa shall strengthen and innovate the teaching and learning processes, enhancing the capacities and capabilities of the graduate water programs. It will create mechanisms and solutions continuing well beyond the project life and strengthening partner universities’ contributions to the lifelong learning of the water professionals. The overall objective is to co-develop, improve and retain the skills, knowledge, tools and other resources needed for the education of higher quality graduates of water-related study programs, conducting more and higher quality water research, and increasing inclusiveness of the partner universities. While the most needs and the outcomes are common to the whole of Africa, the project will demonstrate a systematic approach to medium- and long-term solutions through 8 universities from three neighbouring countries (Kenya, Uganda, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Rwanda and Ghana). The project adresses Higher Education and water related disciplines and will improve teaching facilities, updating of water-related curricula meeting the societal demands, professional development of academic and administrative staff, and improvements in systems and management. Over 70 short term fellowships are planned among the partner universities. The project intends to maximise the efficiency using digital tools also promoting the to the water industry, showcasing the synergetic role of water in a broader thematic perspective. The target group of the project includes: Teaching and research academic staff working with water topic Administrative staff of HEIs operating water programs Students of water-related specialities External stakeholders from the water sector: industrial companies, end-users/utility owners, government institutions and civil society actors Stakeholders at public water sector, line ministries, policy makers and NGO's related to water The VISION of the project is sustainably developing world where global challenges of poverty, inequality, climate change and environmental degradation are reduced, while peace and justice is secured, leaving no one behind. The MISSION of the project is to strengthen the capacity and performance of higher education systems in Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Rwanda and Ghana empowering these countries in realising sustainable development transformation within Water-Health-Environment-Energy Nexus.","The World Economic Forum (WEF, 2020) includes a water crisis in the group of risks with the highest likelihood and impact. WEF defines water crisis under societal risks as a significant decline in the available quality and quantity of freshwater, resulting in harmful effects on human health and/or economic activity. Assessing the progress towards the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the WHO/UNICEF’s Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP, 2017) reports that across the Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC) region, 5.4% (~34 million people) do not have access to improved, safely managed drinking water sources; and 17% (~106 million people) do not have access to improved sanitation. However, when the SDG6 criteria around “safely managed” services are incorporated, these figures grow to 35% (~220 million people) who lack safely managed water services; and 77% (~ 480 million people) who do not have access to safely managed sanitation (JMP, 2017). An estimated 14 billion USD annually will be required to achieve the 2030 targets related to water and sanitation in the LAC (Hutton and Varughese, 2016). Universities have the potential and responsibility to form and contribute to the sustainable development of water resources minimising waste and crisis, as they are producing the policymakers, administrators, engineers, scientists, academics and innovator of tomorrow. The overall idea of the project is to develop knowledge relevant also for the SDGs, starting at Master, PhD/Post.Doc and staff. The purpose is both to focus on some of the SDGs, as well as secure an understanding of their overall integration and the wholeness of the 2030 UN Agenda. The project focuses on why the SDGs need cross- and post-disciplinary teaching and research. The universities have been largely excluded from the discussion when the SDGs’ were formed in the UN and need to be involved in monitoring and reporting, but also to spread knowledge about the importance of Agenda 2030. In Africa, there is a growing realization at ministerial level that the university sector needs to be involved. The Water ESSENCE project focuses on topics with high relevance for the Agenda 2030 and the SDGoals with implications for development: education. water, life on land, energy, health, urban development, and organizational/political leadership and collaboration as conceived by goals 17. Our choice of goals/topics take the lead from the report developed by ""International Council for Science"" (2017) A Guide to SDG Interactions: From Science to Implementation. (Griggs et al. eds)). In this report, a number of goals are selected for the purpose of analysing how they improve the conditions for realizing other goals, but also how they may be detrimental if pursued without an understanding of the wholeness and interconnectedness between the goals. For example, the goal 6: “Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all” This goal show high degree of synergy with poverty, agriculture, greening and recycling of industry, cleaner cities not to mentions the importance for goal 2 (Zero Hunger, Goal 3 (Good Health), Goal 5 (Gender Equality) or Goal 10 (Reduced inequality) and Goal 17 on cooperation.","Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Norwegian University of Science and Technology, University of Nairobi, Machakos University, University of Addis Ababa, Makerere University, University of Juba, University of Rwanda, University of Ghana, University of Development Studies","Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 4, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 9, Goal 10, Goal 11, Goal 13, Goal 14, Goal 15, Goal 17","6.1 , 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b","Sat, 01/01/2022 - 12:00","Thu, 12/31/2026 - 12:00",,0.875,0.0,0.0,0.75,1.0,0.3846153846153861

Water is the most fundamental element of life, yet too few seem to care about it. As a result, rivers are drying up, people are thirstier, conflicts around water are increasing, food is more expensive and difficult to grow. Having clean freshwater available at the right place and in the right amount is always a challenge. Stimulating interest in water issues that are so crucial for our own survival is becoming increasingly urgent. Without this passion, we cannot create the change we want to see.
Water is wealth. Water is a vital natural resource without which life would cease to exist. Solving the water puzzle can help to address biodiversity loss, climate change impacts, unsustainable food production and urbanisation around the world. And of course, the most challenging goal is to reach the billions of people that remain without access to affordable water and sanitation. There is no doubt that water deserves our attention, respect, and protection. Understanding the value of water can promote better management, conservation, and protection of finite resources.
Our volunteer-run platform is a digital space for the free flow of ideas and open transparent governance, providing an unmatched and innovative look at water issues and practices from around the world. We tell stories about water that inspire and, perhaps, change your perception of our most precious resource. We bridge formats, geographical regions, political borders, and language barriers through direct engagement with individuals and organisations. We constantly strive to be more accessible to both technical and lay audience and encourage action. Our content dovetails scientific information with applied field experiences to frame water issues in a balanced perspective.","Our goal is to make people care more for the invaluable and endangered resources that is water. To allow anyone to make better decisions when it comes to water and its conservation on a everyday basis and on every level - from a household to the government. 
Our platform will facilitate both global and local discussions on water-related topics, with people across different field and professions publishing for free on Water Science Policy and having their work translated into numerous global languages.

            Annual Report",Perú,Peru,Latin America and the Caribbean,"The annual calculation of the Effective Water Treatment Indicator (TEAR) is a key tool to measure the country’s progress in the implementation of sustainable wastewater treatment and disposal practices. This indicator is part of target 6.3 of SDG 6, which seeks to improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating spills and minimizing emissions of hazardous chemicals and materials, halving the percentage of untreated wastewater and substantially increasing safe reuse and water recycling worldwide. The implementation of the annual TEAR calculation will allow to assess the country’s progress in meeting this target, identify areas in which greater attention is required and promote the adoption of more sustainable wastewater treatment and disposal practices.","The calculation of the indicator shows that, by 2021, 74% of the population was connected to a drainage network, 5% depended on septic wells and the remaining 21% had other forms of sanitation systems in situ (such as black wells or letrines) or practiced outdoor defecation.
By observing the proportion of safe-treated household wastewater flows, Peru has shown positive and sustained progress in household sewage treatment, rising from 16% in 2015 to 50% in 2021. This represents a growth of 34 percentage points and is derived from an increase in both the proportion of households connected to drainage and in the greater treatment capacity in PTARs (waste treatment plants managed by the country’s providers).
By observing PTAR treatment capacity, between 2016 and 2021, the proportion of waste water collected through drainage systems that received treatment increased from 66% to 79%. This increase of 13 percentage points was largely due to the launch of the La Chira plant, which now treats the wastewater of the southern districts of Lima. Of all wastewater received in PTARs, 65% were treated safely with wastewater that complies with national environmental standards.",,Goal 6,6.3,"Tue, 10/31/2023 - 12:00","Sun, 12/31/2023 - 12:00",,0.125,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05494505494505515

This is only possible if water tariffs are calculated and remain affordable and adapted to costs to be recovered. Unfortunately, they are still often decided by Gouvernements and do not reflect the economic situation of the sector. It is therefore not sustainable. Involvement of the private sector in the management of the facilities in rural areas is necessary to guarantee a professional and sustainable access to potable water. But the revenues and profits are too low to allow for private investment. Cost of infrastructures should therefore be born by IFIs and cost of operation and maintenance covered by the tariff. We have been the first private operator to invest in a rural water supply project in Mali at big scale to get a 15 year contract to manage water points. We proved that investing is not viable at that stage. But we keep on working on the definition of conditions of success for an investment to be possible in the future. We need Donors and Governments to realize the reality of field situation.","We are in the process of developing a new concept to reach sustainability in the rural water supply sector. We created a company, UDUMA, for that purpose. Our experiences in Mali and Burkina Faso allowed us to win a contract at national level in Benin where the World Bank is financing the infrastructures and we, as private operator, manage the systems for 10 years. We are also implementing a pilot on public service delegation to a private operator in Côte d'Ivoire. There is an urgent need for infrastructure but who is going to pay? Increase ""financing as usual"" only is not what is needed as there is a critical lack of capacity in many countries to absorb fundings.

National innovation ecosystems all over the world deliver new solutions constantly; in the form of new technologies or new ways of doing things. There is therefore a cornucopia of solutions already available or close to being available, but the deployment of these new solutions in the field is not on par with the growth and severity of the water problems we face. Many barriers are in the way for effective deployment of innovative solutions. Some are related to elements of the innovation ecosystem itself, such a market access, legal systems, access to credit etc. and others present themselves when technology is transferred across regions and borders. Intellectual property rights often play an important role in making this transfer happen and an efficient and fair intellectual property rights system is fundamental for a well-functioning innovation ecosystem. Yet, probably one of the largest barriers is lack of knowledge of the availability of solutions and understanding of their technical and economic feasibility. Through the WIPO GREEN platform, we are committed to promoting the knowledge of feasible solutions and matching them to pertinent needs. We have developed an advanced database of needs and green technologies where solution providers can upload their innovations and be matched against published needs. Besides more than 3600 uploads by companies and other needs and solutions owners, we have some 125.000 green technology patents, made particularly useful through a dedicated “Patent2Solution” AI-supported search function. The database is a free public resource. Currently, the database contains more than 3000 needs and solutions in relation to water issues, and a dedicated water category page provides further details on the 10 water sub-categories. The database is the technical backbone of the solutions promotion and matchmaking activities of WIPO GREEN. In the acceleration projects we identify on-the-ground needs in specific subject areas and countries and use the database for active solutions matchmaking and repository of findings. As part of these projects we produce needs and technology catalogues where water issues often dominate. The new annual WIPO Flagship publication “Green Technology Book”, launched at COP27 in Egypt showcase and explain more than 200 solutions within climate change adaptation. One of the three main sections is dedicated to “Water and coastal regions” and all solutions are directly linked to the database. As part of our continued commitment to the UN Water agenda, we will make the database available to other relevant organizations who wish to have an advanced repository of needs and solutions in the water sector. Such organizations can be allocated a purpose-built, branded, entry into the data stored in the database while still being able to benefit from the advanced search and matchmaking functions. Over time, such additions could create a leading water needs and technology hub, and WIPO is committed to support the development of the database according to demand.","Leveraging the transformative power of green technology to accelerate efforts for water action, through • Facilitating access to – and transfer of - water technology solutions through matchmaking opportunities enabled by the platform and associated accelerator projects • Wider dissemination of information/knowledge on existing technological solutions and/or potential solutions under development • Promoting a better understanding of the water technology and innovation landscape Water touches on every aspect of human life, as such it underpins the realization of most of the SDGs be it directly or indirectly.

The DWP is financed by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Finance and implemented jointly by IAWD (International Association of Water Service Companies in the Danube River catchment area) and the World Bank.
The DWP brings together regional, national and local stakeholders in the water supply and sanitation sector. The main objectives are
- to strengthen the water sector tailored to the regional circumstances and at different levels: i) at political level by creating the policy and regulatory environment that sparks innovation and warrants the sustainable development of the sector and ii) at utility level through inclusive education and capacity development and training initiatives
- to foster a common understanding of the state of the water sector by providing the data and knowledge required for a cross-sectoral transformation and supporting water, climate and food security related policy integration
- to overcome languages barriers in the Danube region and
- to harmonise DWP supported analytical and advisory services to national governments with existing investment projects of International Financing Institutions in the region, taking into account externalities and co-benefits.

These innovations will manoeuvre the water market towards a 50% reduction of pressure on our natural water system and a more effective resilience against the impact of demographic and climate change. Water Europe manages three programmes to achieve this objective: 1. A Collaboration Programme to bring challenge owners and solutions providers together to network, exchange knowledge and experiences. In this respect Water Europe and its partners support the creation of Water-Oriented Living Labs, which are water-oriented, real-life demonstration and implementation instrument that brings together public and private institutions, government, civil society, and academia to jointly build structured grounds to develop, validate, and scale-up water-related innovations that embrace new technologies, governance, business models, and innovative policies. 2.

Current data demonstrate that the world community needs to quadruple the efforts in order to achieve targets by 2030. Although, the proportion of global population using safely managed drinking water services increased from 70% in 2015 to 74% in 2020, still 2 billion people lack access to those services. Eight out of ten individuals who lack access to even the most basic source of drinking water live in rural regions, with roughly half of them residing in least developed countries. For instance, in Sub-Saharan Africa, only 30% of the overall population has access to safely managed drinking water services by the end of 2020. At the current rate of progress, the world will reach 81 per cent coverage by 2030, missing the target and leaving 1.6 billion people without safely managed drinking water services. Moreover, climate change and its magnifying effects worsen the situation. Therefore, urgent, concrete and collaborative action is needed to accelerate the progress and achieve SDG 6 goals by 2030. In this context, Türkiye takes humanitarian responsibility and provides financial and technical assistance in the water sector beyond her borders with the ultimate aim of achieving the SDGs by 2030 leaving no one behind. In line with this vision, Türkiye has launched various works in different parts of the world, especially in Africa. Türkiye has drilled 512 wells to supply drinking water for 1,85 million people in Africa and completed the planning, design and construction of a large-scale hydraulic project including a dam on the Ambouli River in Djibouti -fully financed by the Turkish Government (€11 million) -to provide domestic water to the capital city of Djibouti and to protect the city from potential floods. Additionally, Türkiye has great experience in implementing integrated water resources management via basin level management plans of which are rigorously being prepared and implemented in all her basins to ensure access to safe and clean water and sanitation for all in the scope of the SDG 6 and sharing her experiences through trainings and technical assistance activities in other countries.

Through their funding activities and client relationships, financial institutions have a major impact on water security and hold the power to accelerate and mainstream the sustainable transition of water impactful industries. At the same time, how companies manage water risks and capitalize on opportunities may drive long-term returns for shareholders.
Through CDP, 275 of the world’s largest financial institutions, controlling more than $20 trillion in assets under management, have demonstrated commitment to act on water. Covering the four core segments of the finance sector (banks, asset managers, asset owners, and insurance), they spread across all 6 continents with 45 countries represented.
More than half (148) of these organisations already measure the impact of their portfolios on water security, or have committed to do so in the next two years. 97 are in the process of developing products and services to enable clients to mitigate water insecurity, with 84% of these targeting key water activities (such as agribusiness, corporate real estate, and corporate loans). A quarter of respondents (72) have a policy framework for portfolio activities in place which includes water-related requirements that clients/investees need to meet. Over a fifth (60) exercise voting rights as a shareholder on water-related issues, with 56 financial institutions supporting the reduction of water pollution and/or  withdrawals/consumption, and 14 supporting the provision of safe and equitable WASH services.
Through these actions, disclosed to CDP for the first time in 2022, financial institutions are institutionalizing water. And the financial benefit is clear – just 23 financial institutions reported a potential increase in revenue of US$203 billion as a result of committing to water-related opportunities. These commitments are already sending signals to companies that water needs to be brought into the boardroom, and this is having impact:
In 2022, BBVA created the first syndicated loan that is linked to the water footprint of a company, taken by Iberdrola, a Spanish renewable energy company. This loan assesses Iberdrola’s CDP water score and progress against its target to reduce water consumption in the generation of energy by 50% by 2030. Meanwhile, ACTIAM identifies companies for their water-neutral portfolio which are reporting to CDP, reducing water use, and setting targets, as well as those that can add to the transition to a water neutral society by helping others to become water efficient by putting low-water impact products and services on the market.
Corporate data on water is critical for financial institutions to carry out these commitments: to inform and advance shareholder engagement with companies to improve environmental performance; to better understand the link between environmental and financial performance; and in a variety of financial products, including stock market indices and, increasingly, as with BBVA, water sustainability-linked loans.
National governments have a critical role in ensuring financial systems are aligned with national and international water security targets. Making water disclosure mandatory for companies and financial institutions is a critical first step.","Every company, in every sector has a part to play in the transition to a water secure, decarbonised and deforestation-free economy. However, the finance sector is especially critical. Huge amounts of capital will need to be directed to actions that enhance water security, and enhancing resilience to ever looming water-related risks. It is clear that the finance sector needs to play a major role in this.
Responses from 275 financial institutions reported through CDP has illustrated the variety and extent of actions that are putting water at the heart of financial decisions. Not only will these actions encourage companies to develop business models that are fit for the future and hence protect jobs, they will contribute to direct reductions in water impact, having positive consequences for communities and ecosystems.",,"Goal 2, Goal 6, Goal 8, Goal 12, Goal 17","6.3, 6.4, 8.4, 12.4, 12.6, 17.3, 17.17","Tue, 06/01/2021 - 12:00","Sun, 12/31/2028 - 12:00","https://guidance.cdp.net/en/guidance?cid=46&ctype=theme&idtype=ThemeID&…

It enables real-time sharing of information, alignment of efforts, periodic updates of contribution and the establishment of a strategic and integrated approach for action and investment in the water sector leading to socioeconomic and environmental benefits in the region through increased investment in appropriate infrastructure, empowerment of marginalized or vulnerable groups, and more sustainable use of resources.
The platform focuses on action mapping related to water security. Each registered action will be linked to relevant water security category (which are derived from the global indicator related to water security, such as Asian Water Development Outlook and SDGs). This will enable to facilitate learning exchange between actions. Open program will also provide assistance to develop annual multistakeholder contribution report on water security achievement and ultimately to facilitate the alignment and consolidation of water security program in the country.","The program aims to assist in prioritizing and targeting actions to mobilize water investments across the Southeast Asia region. It will enable this through the tracking of the progress of actions to identify bottlenecks to guide action and to narrow the water investment gap where they exist. It will also mobilize political leadership and commitment to accelerating action and financing of water investments and promote accountability. The IWSOP will strengthen partnerships, foster collaboration and knowledge sharing, changes in practices and the realignment of actions towards a more strategic approach for improved water governance.
A results framework for the IWSOP has been developed identifying the program’s overall intended impact, outcomes and outputs, and the indicators at these three levels that will used to measure achievement. It aligns with GWP’s Results Framework with its vision of a water secure world where GWP support countries to advance the governance and management of water resources for sustainable and equitable development. The IWSOP addresses GWP’s three dimensional approach: “We Act” - through catalysing change in policies and practices, “We Learn” - through generating and communicating knowledge, and “We Mobilise” - through strengthening partnerships. 
ISWOP Impact: A higher level of water security achieved by each country, in transboundary basins, and the Southeast Asia region.
IWSOP Impact indicators:
1. Number of countries in the region that show a positive trend in strengthening water security resulting in an improved status under the 5 key dimensions of AWDO and SDG 6 Global Monitoring.
2. Value of investment (infrastructure, capacity building, water policies) increased for Water Security and IWRM actions in the Region
The anticipated outcome of the Water Security Open Platform is that a country-wide and regional prospectus of water resource management actions is established at all levels enabling policy makers, financing institutions, multi-stakeholders and planners to make more informed decisions and take action; and the alignment of government and non-government stakeholders’ efforts on the ground enabling a clear understanding of current and future investment in water resource management actions to develop a strategic approach to these investments resulting in improved water governance in achieving water security goals and implementation of IWRM principles in the Southeast Asia Region.",-,"Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 6, Goal 13, Goal 14, Goal 15","2.4 , 3.9, 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.a, 13.b, 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5, 14.6, 14.7, 14.a, 14.b, 14.c, 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5, 15.6, 15.7, 15.8, 15.9, 15.a, 15.b, 15.c","Thu, 03/31/2022 - 12:00",,https://www.gwp.org/en/GWP-South-East-Asia/WE-ACT/programmes/integrated…,1.0,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.4395604395604412

1) Identify and engage with critical dialogues in which global water policy is being shaped (the upcoming COPs, World Water Week, UN Climate Ambition Summit, among others), mainly by corporate and other powerful actors, and fiercely but compassionately challenge prevailing narratives and policies being set forth advocating for endless growth;
2) Insert into these spaces alternative narratives and models, honoring Indigenous ways of being and cherishing this planet (de-growth economics, Rights of Nature legal reform, and environmental flows, among others), all articulating the primacy of nature's limits, the impossibility of endless growth, and need for profound planetary transformation;
3) Create a series of three related webinars and intimate conversations which honestly discuss the fear, isolation, and despair many people feel around the world, watching rivers and aquifers dry leading to migration and increasingly repressive political environments.

            A publicly available global dataset of FI water data, annual public ranking of FI performance, an accompanying online tracking mechanism and a raft of new data agreements. ","CDP´s work to increase water-related transparency of the financial sector started in 2021 and has already produced evidence that financial institutions (FIs) are beginning to act to reduce portfolio water-related impacts.  
This evidence is already presented in public interface and will be used by academics, civil society and financial regulators to inform policy responses to the water-related risks and opportunities the sector faces.",Ibero-American Network of Life Cycle Assesment,Global,"Private finance has been identified as one of the key pillars of the UN Global Acceleration Framework for SDG 6 and rightly so. Achieving a water secure, net zero economy will require a complete transformation of our global economy. Triggering such a transformation is a game-changer. 
Private financial institutions (FIs) can offer unique, systemic incentives for change by ensuring their investment, insurance, lending, rating and underwriting practices drive these water users to use water wisely, to not pollute water, and to promote its reuse. Banks, shareholders and the FIs that own or lend to them currently enable companies to undertake economic activities, which in many cases are profoundly detrimental to the environment.  
And yet, while members of the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening and Financial Systems (NGFS), and the European Central Bank (ECB) have all acknowledged the need for financial institutions to disclose water-related data, they stop short in recommending exactly what should be reported and only 1 jurisdiction has currently mandated water-related reporting for financial institutions.  
CDP is committed to filling this policy gap by inviting more than 1,200 of the world’s largest, systemically important Financial Institutions to regularly report the water-related risks and impacts that they are exposed to through their financing activities and publicly benchmarking the actions they are taking to mitigate these. By doing so, we seek to reduce the flow of capital to water destructive activities and businesses and increase flow to those that value water appropriately. 
With $148 trillion in assets under management, the banking sector alone is larger and more powerful than it has ever been and yet, until now, the world does not have the data to understand whether that money was working in favour of our water goals, or, as is most likely the case, undermining our ability to achieve them. CDP’s commitment will address this gap and accelerate change.","By focusing on private financial institutions, this intervention ensures a key accountability lever in the global water sector is activated and empowered to act in line with global ambitions regarding water security.  
To stem the water security crisis, businesses, which wield control or influence over 70% of the world’s freshwater reserves, must change their approach to how they use and impact upon this resource, in essence, learning to operate differently. Many of these companies are transnational and as such, their growth plans and strategies are beyond the influence of any one national government. So, while national governments can exert control over how a particular factory within its jurisdiction engages with water, it cannot influence the way in which the company that owns 5,000 other factories around the world chooses to respond. It would take a concerted and highly coordinated effort by multiple governments to bring just one firm into line with international water goals. FIs, on the other hand, can and do exert this type of influence, giving them unparalleled potential to shift companies toward a more sustainable future. They also have the potential to significantly influence the course the corporate sector takes on exposure and vulnerability to water dependencies, and water stewardship. 
Through this initiative, we expect to make governments, regulators and FIs aware of the actions that are underway and understand what more is needed to align finance with a water secure world and provide academics and civil society with the data they need to enhance accountability and generate new knowledge.",,"Goal 2, Goal 6, Goal 8, Goal 9, Goal 12, Goal 14, Goal 15, Goal 16, Goal 17","12.6, 12.7, 14.1, 14.2, 15.1, 17.14, 17.17, 6.3, 6.4, 8.4, 9.4","Tue, 06/01/2021 - 12:00","Sun, 12/31/2028 - 12:00","https://guidance.cdp.net/en/guidance?cid=46&ctype=theme&idtype=ThemeID&…

Diseases such as diarrhea is the primary cause of child mortality in Indonesia. Typhoid is also a leading threat to the health of Indonesians. Both diarrhea and typhoid are amplified by inadequate sanitation, poor hygiene and limited water supply. GWP-SEA has developed an e-platform to register water and/or sanitation facility at household level to provide a proper WASH database and monitoring system in the targeted villages. This database is expected to strengthen the village officials’ capacity on evidence-based planning, budgeting and monitoring evaluation for village WASH Program. This e-survey platform for water and sanitation hygiene were used to assist Safe Water Gardens program in increasing access to safe and proper sanitation at three village in Bintan Regency. In collaboration with Water Stewardship Indonesia (WSI) through the Safe Water Gardens (SWG) program, GWP-SEA conducted a series of training for the enumerators for the 3 villages in Bintan Regency between December 2022 - January 2023.

We aim to contribute to the Water Action Agenda by putting our data at the disposal of national and international policymakers, academics, NGOs, Central Banks and Financial Institutions. In this respect, we have established data partnerships with hundreds of institutions including the UN system, which uses the environmental data reported by companies, cities, states and regions though CDP to compile the UNFCCC Global Climate Action Portal, the Net-Zero Data Public Utility (NZDPU) and track non –state actor progress in the Race to Zero and Race to Resilience.",Ibero-American Network of Life Cycle Assesment,Global,"CDP has been operating the world’s only global corporate water disclosure mechanism since 2009. Since then, voluntary water disclosures via CDP have increased substantially and CDP now holds the world’s largest corporate water dataset. The corporate water security questionnaire at the heart of CDP’s disclosure mechanism aligns with the highest quality frameworks and standards, and represents the gold standard in corporate water disclosure. With transparency being the basis for effective accountability and action, CDP tracks key performance indicators such as corporate strategy and governance; targets; water accounting; value chain engagement activities; business impacts; risk assessment procedures; as well as risks, opportunities and responses to them.
CDP leverages the authority of capital markets and major buyers to incentivise transparency and action. Working with more than 680 financial institutions with over $130 trillion in assets, and over 280 major buyers with $6.4tn in purchasing power, CDP pioneered using capital markets and corporate procurement to motivate companies to disclose and act on their water impacts, and to safeguard water resources. Companies are asked to disclose annually through CDP by their customers and investors. By completing CDP's questionnaire on water security and being benchmarked against CDP’s international corporate water scoring methodology, companies are compelled to understand and eliminate their water-related impacts, risks and opportunities as well as provide vital information to the market. In the last decade CDP has transformed how the market engages with water security, but we know we have further to go.
In 2022, almost 4,000 companies disclosed through CDP on water security. CDP is now committing to have relevant water-related data for a significantly bigger proportion of public and private companies, including 90% of the world’s highest-impact companies by 2025. In addition, we are committed to increasing access to our data by providing more information, insights and analysis to the public sector and civil society. Making the data publicly available to a wider group of stakeholders will increase scrutiny and collective ambition, driving bold, transformative and rapid action. We’re already making significant progress.
Companies that have been consistently disclosing to CDP over the last 12 years:
·	re-align growth projections, financial plans and public policy positions with the achievement of global water goals;
·	they bring the basin into the boardroom by mapping and reporting the revenues at risk per river basin and putting a price on direct and indirect water risks and impacts;
·	they increase investment in solutions from the millions to the billions;
·	they establish targets on WASH, pollution and withdrawals and tie these into corporate governance mechanisms, such as CEO remuneration;
·	they integrate water expectations into supply chain contracts and reward suppliers for their pursuit of better water stewardship; and
·	they are benefiting from lower costs of capital due to the greater levels of trust realised by being transparent.","More companies than ever are disclosing on water issues and disclosure is driving water stewardship. We’ve witnessed an 85% growth in corporate water disclosure through CDP in the last five years, with a 16% increase in 2022 alone. 3,909 of the world’s largest, most impactful companies now measure, manage and report their water risks and impacts through CDP – up from 2,113 in 2018. Encouragingly, almost half of responders are reporting water-related opportunities that have the potential to have a significant strategic or financial impact on their business. From permeable concrete to washing-up liquid, sugar to bank loans, 40% of companies reporting via CDP are identifying, innovating, and introducing new products and services to business customers and individual consumers. 50% of responders are now setting water-related targets. And 66% have lowered or maintained (±10%) freshwater withdrawals, since first reporting to CDP.
Crucially the information disclosed is shared with stakeholders – including investors, purchasing companies, policy actors, civil society, and consumers. With this data, these stakeholders are empowered to make better informed decisions, hold companies to account, and signal their expectations through the allocation of capital. This compels companies to act.
Investors, in particular, are increasingly demanding and making use of such water-related data. More transparency provides more certainty for investors. How a company is addressing water risks and accounting for water security issues in its growth strategies and governance is vital information for investors. If this data is hidden from view, it is difficult, if not impossible, for investors to evaluate a company’s performance and make investment decisions accordingly.
At CDP, we are committed to increasing our focus on incentivising tens of thousands of companies to align their business models, goods and services with the achievement of a water secure world over the next 8 years and as such, we expect to see a flood of new water smart products enter the markets accompanied by radical reductions in freshwater demands and pollution impacts from the private sector. For example, BBVA has created a new sustainable loan that focuses on reducing companies’ water footprint, a key priority in many companies’ sustainability policies. The ‘water footprint’ loan is a sub-type of loan that considers specific water indicators and CDP’s Water score to offer preferential rates of interest to companies reducing their water impacts.",,"Goal 2, Goal 6, Goal 8, Goal 9, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 14, Goal 15, Goal 17","2.4 , 6.3, 6.4, 8.4, 9.2 , 12.6, 12.7, 13.1, 14.1, 14.2, 15.1, 15.5, 17.14, 17.17","Tue, 11/01/2022 - 12:00","Fri, 03/31/2028 - 12:00",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaXzsA-dfrs,0.25,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

Gender Transformative Water Climate and Development Program (WACDEP-G) is part of the Continental Africa Water Investment Program (AIP). The main objective of AIP-WACDEP-G is to transform gender inequalities at scale by promoting gender-transformative planning, decision-making and institutional development for climate resilient water investments in Africa.
The program is mainly supporting government mandated institutions to ensure that gender equality is integrated in their water and climate resilience programs. This is through analysis, capacity development, demonstrating innovative ideas/approaches, stakeholder mobilization and dialogues.
The program is implemented by Global Water Partnership (GWP), based in Sweden. In Africa, GWP has Africa Coordination Unit in Pretoria, South Africa which is responsible for the coordination of the implementation of the program working with GWP regions and countries. GWP in Africa has five regional offices, Eastern Africa in Uganda, Central Africa in Cameroon, West Africa in Burkina Faso, North Africa in Tunisia and Southern Africa in South Africa. GWP regions are responsible for implementing the program in their respective regions working with the country offices. 
The following are the main intervention areas:
       + Gender Capacity development and learning: Towards changing the mindset and raising commitment for gender transformative approach
       + Gender in Decision Making Processes: integrating gender equality in Development and climate change Plans, Resource allocations such as National Adaptation
          Plans (NAPS) and Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)
       + Gender in Climate and Water Strategies, Plans, Programs, Projects: Integrating gender in Water Investment Programs, integrating gender in new programs and
         projects, integrating gender in Climate Strategy etc.
       +Demonstrating gender transformative approach in Water Security and  Climate Resilience Building
        + capturing lessons and facilitating experience sharing 
The main approach for implementing the program is through supporting mandated institutions
    + Pan-African Level: African Union Commission (AUC), AUDA-NEPAD, African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW)
    + Regional/Basin Organizations Level: RECs, RBOs
    + Country Level: Ministries of Water, Climate, Gender, Finance and Planning","The initiative is expected to ensure that Africa's investment in water security integrates climate resilience and gender equality. The main focus is water security (SDG 6) in a changing climate. This requires building climate resilience of water systems and investments in Africa (SDG 13). It also considers environmental sustainability of the entire natural system (SDG 15). The program is implemented through mobilizing stakeholders, resources and strengthening capacities of key actors (SDG 17).  Climate Resilient water security will not be sustained if the issues of inclusiveness are integrated. The program emphasizes that gender equality is critical for ensuring sustainable and resilience water systems in Africa (SDG 5).
The program is expected to accelerate SDG implementation through:
   + strengthening capacity for integrating gender equality, for preparing investment programs and projects, and for accessing climate finance.
   + facilitating multi-stakeholder dialogues.
   + facilitating sharing of good practices and knowledge that will be generated from demonstrating innovative approaches.
   + providing analytical support on the baseline situation and strengthening capacity to track progress.","African Union Commission

            Establishing Community Water Conservation System in the tribal areas of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat states of India","Indigenous communities of 1000 villages in tri-junction area of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh",India,Asia and Pacific,"Introduction: Water is an important element which significantly contributes to the life cycle of human beings, animals, plants and all living things. Since ages, it has been conserved by the society through their various traditions and culture, but due to its invaluable importance, now it is being treated like a commodity, which has created the space for its marketization. The region where the indigenous communities in Central Western India live is usually a hilly terrain, having undulated lands,  due to which water retention of rainwater is poor and crop failure is a usual phenomenon. Various development works have resulted in increased water consumption and contamination of its sources. 
Methodology: For years, VAAGDHARA has been organizing discussions with indigenous people on water sovereignty through dialogue march. In these march,  the community disseminate their various traditional methods of water conservation and harvesting, practices of reliable and judicious usage of water, establishing its linkage with other related elements of the society. In this dialogue process, the indigenous community demonstrates the significance of water in their lives and how their control over water resources and their traditional methods of conservation have been an essential element of their sovereignty. 
Dissemination: With the aim to revamp and re-establish the significance of water sovereignty, indigenous people will undertake a community march to disseminate their traditional knowledge and practices of water conservation to other communities and will also recommended appropriate solutions and policies related to it. Their key message to other communities will emphasize on aliveness of water, which cannot be commercialised as trade. Development in terms of modernization is acceptable but water sovereignty should not be compromised. If water is felt as soul of life, no one can think of trading it but will conserve it for the upcoming generations.
Governance: There are enormous opportunities for the government, civil societies and individuals to protect water, development of new resources with clean and safe water, which will be highlighted to help create a conducive policy environment. Efforts will be done to incorporate traditional methods of water conservation and harvesting, into policies. While communities will be encouraged to revive and replicate these practices in other areas. The approach of Community based water governance will be disseminated which could be effective if reinforced at local, regional and national level to ensure reliable and prioritized use of water.","The action will be important in making the communities responsible for conservation of water through various mechanisms as well as working on other associated factors related to water in the ecosystem. It is envisaged that the communities will take lead for water governance in their villages as well as upto national level, which will eventually ensure reliable, judicious, and prioritized use of water. This might help support in resolving various issues related with promotion of more efficient irrigation technologies, water harvesting, better crop selection practices, which can support the water conservation. The indigenous communities who adopted circular lifestyle, by minimizing or eliminating the waste and utilizing renewable sources, promotes restorative and regenerative processes which is helpful in climate resilient agriculture. VAAGDHARA emphasizes on promoting strong involvement of the community in the village development planning process, with equal participation of men and women, to come up with more pragmatic solutions to their needs and the changes required in the government policies. At this platform, various strategies are discussed to achieve SDGs and the community is provided with the solutions to their problems, which further provides them with a sustainable path of development. Through this action, communities will be enabled to develop and submit individual and community plans for Water Conservation related works to local governance. In countries like India, having agriculture-based economy, this action will help in creating a policy environment for efficient conservation and usage of water required for agriculture by developing community water resources, resulting in improved and sustainable livelihood of all.","1) 26 Krishi evam Adivasi Swaraj Sangathan (Peoples' organizations) in 1000 villages of Rajasthan, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh

            Eradicate water poverty and water slavery for 75,000 indigenous peoples",Indigenous peoples living along the northern western ghats of the Sahyadri mountain ranges in India who are stuck in a vicious cycle of poverty an ddeprivation due to water scarcity.,India,West Asia,"Background: Over the past decade Raah Foundation through multiple iterations has created a model of rainwater harvesting that works on both supply-side enhancement and regulating the demand side. This model has been replicated multiple times making 110 villages completely water-positive directly impacting over 60,000 people. This has eradicated water poverty and communities are on a virtuous cycle of growth and development. Raah Foundation is committed to replicating this model and making 100 villages water secure by 2030. 
Objective: Eradicate Water poverty by making every village and community water secure and positive by catching every drop that falls from the sky and ensuring judicious water usage. 
Implementations:
Demand Side: Understand the water demand (drinking for humans & cattle), hygiene & farming. Create a gender-neutral village-level water management committee to regulate water usage.
Supply Side: Map the existing water structures and curate the solution to make the village positive based on the demand for water over the next decade. Enhance the existing structures, repair them, and improve their capacity. Build recharge ponds and percolation pits to improve the groundwater table The water management committee is strengthened through capacity building on water governance, maintenance of rainwater harvesting structures, and created rules and regulations to ensure equitable water usage.  The committee meets once a quarter and takes stock of the water levels in all the structures and is taught to take decisions around water usage based on this.
Raah Foundation works for one year closely monitors the situation, participates in all committee meetings, and exits once the short-term impact is seen. 
KPI's:
* Water Demand is less than Water available ensuring that the village never runs out of water
* #hours saved by a woman on fetching water and any income generated through these saved hours
* reduction in health-related incidences as now adequate water is available to ensure better hygiene & cleanliness.
* #girls finishing school as they do need to labor for water now.
#farmers growing year-round crops as now enough water is available
#change in the family income due to water 
Follow Up:
Once Raah Foundation exits - an annual follow-up is done for five years. For this water management committee submits an annual report and a visit to validate the report is undertaken. 
Long-term Impact:
Water scarcity destroys the fabric of the family and compromises everything including the rich indigenous culture. Through our work, we make villages water positive which ensures that communities stay healthy and a virtuous cycle of growth is created in their own villages which ensures cultural continuity and presevation of cultural heritage while improving the rural economy.","Our Water security model has impacted over 60,000 people directly living across 110 villages.
This action will replicate our model to bring water security to 100 more villages by 2030 benefitted additional 75,000 people. 
Water underpins all social problems and water availability creates a virtuous cycle of growth and development and has the potential to eradicate poverty and hunger, and improve health and hygiene. Water is, unfortunately, a woman's subject and in absence of water availability in her village she becomes a water slave. Water availability improves her condition and ensures she has enough time to participate in the economic development of the family and the community. She has time and energy for her children and they grow up in a loving caring atmosphere which reduces or eliminates the chances of becoming malnourished. These indigenous communities are small and marginal farmers who grow the monsoon crops of paddy and millets for self-consumption (while this ensures food security it doesn't bring any income from these crops). Once they harvest these crops, after Diwali they start foraging to search for work and lead a life of desperation. Women stay behind and become water slaves. There is no happiness, no family life, and no income locally only poverty, deprivation, and helplessness. This water poverty unfortunately is intergenerational.  
Our work on SDG 6 directly and positively impacts SDG 1, SDG 2, SDG 3, SDG 4, SDG 5, SDG 8, SDG 10, SDG 13, and SDG 15. 
Once the village becomes water secure (year-round water available for human drinking, cattle drinking, hygiene, and farming), women save over 1500 hours per year and use this time to earn an additional income for the family, men start growing year-round crops, and lead a life of dignity, children grow up in love and families practice their unique culture and ensure its continuity. 
Our action will bring all the above benefits to another 75,000 people over the next 7 years. 
We are also partnering with other organisations and sharing our model of eardicating water poverty and slavery which would ensure a bigger impact.","* Village-level water management committees

This program has already created an extensive network of partnerships, which involves and has already benefited 42 regulators of these services in 19 countries in this region of Latin America and the Caribbean, in addition to Portugal.
There is additional involvement in this program of international organizations, as advisors and supporters, such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), the World Health Organization (WHO), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), the Sanitation and Water Association for All (SWA), the International Water Association (IWA), the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (CEPAL), and the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI).
This program has a strong potential for scalability, visibility, and global impact to improve public policies and regulation in other regions of the world, and preliminary contacts are already being established with other regional regulatory networks, and International Financial Institutions, to enlarge this program to other regions, with knowledge sharing and good practice.
Responding to the challenge of the United Nations for the presentation of voluntary commitments and concrete actions, joining nations, actors, and professionals in the sector to contribute to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Ministry of Environment and Climate Action of Portugal commits to develop efforts to launch a Global Coalition for Better Policies and Regulation of Water and Sanitation Services.
The Ministry of Environment and Climate Action of Portugal will invite other Member States around the world, International Financial Institutions, cooperation agencies and other donors, international organizations, regional networks of regulators and other relevant actors to join this Global Coalition for Better Policies and Regulation of Water and Sanitation Services in a view to contribute to accelerate SDG6 and other water-related Goals implementation.","Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 4, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 8, Goal 9, Goal 10, Goal 11, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 14, Goal 15, Goal 16, Goal 17","1.4, 1.5, 1.b, 2.4 , 3.3, 3.9, 3.d, 4.1, 4.5, 5.1 , 5.4 , 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 7.2, 7.3, 8.5, 9.1, 9.4, 10.4, 11.1 , 11.5, 11.a, 11.b, 12.1, 12.2, 12.5, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.a, 14.1, 14.2, 14.5, 15.1, 15.3, 15.5, 15.8, 16.5, 16.6, 16.7, 17.3, 17.6, 17.7, 17.9, 17.14, 17.16, 17.17","Wed, 03/22/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2030 - 12:00","Presentation of the RegWAS program:

Beneficiaries include all those who stand to benefit from the achievement of water security on a global scale.,"France, Netherlands, Ibero-American Network of Life Cycle Assesment",Global,"In January 2023 CDP, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the Water Footprint Network (WFN), funded by the Dutch Government's Valuing Water Initiative, kicked-off a project dedicated to Catalysing the Water Action Agenda for Finance.
One of the main outputs of the project is to put together a first-of-its-kind Finance Water Action Pathway. The partners will leverage their expertise in the fields of financial services sustainability disclosure, capital markets, water foot printing and water security. We will also use our existing, extensive networks to engage and consult with various financial actors and selected experts to help us along the process of building a first draft Pathway. The Pathway concept will be endorsed in New York in March 2023 at the Water UN Conference.
Given the many sustainability challenges the finance sector is facing, we strive to align our Finance Water Action Pathway with ongoing/existing initiatives. Specifically, we based our draft pathway structure on the UN’s Climate Action Pathway for Finance. It will consist of sections presenting the vision by 2030, a system transformation summary, the key levers of change and the specific actions to be taken within each area and the existing progress made on the issue. Last but not least, the Pathway will set high level vetted, ambitious, specific, measurable, actionable and timebound milestones for the financial sector.","Water, as an inseparable part of nature and economic stability, is an essential resource that needs to be considered by financial institutions when making decisions about their portfolio activities. Financial institutions (FIs) have the power to influence or incentivize the transformation of whole sectors in ways that single governments cannot. Through their lending, investment, insurance and underwriting practices, FIs can drive the various water users to use water wisely, to not pollute it, and to promote its reuse. Financial institutions can spur the development, upscaling and uptake of critical technologies, policies and practices through the adoption of bold commitments to water security and through their cascading influence on the entire economy via portfolio holdings, loan books and other assets. 
Short term impact of the project:
o Demonstrates that action on water amongst private finance is already underway.
o Establishes the level of water-related ambition and transformation needed in the sector.
o Characterises pathways to accelerate the transformation
Long term impact:
Drives financial institutions to:
o Achieve water-related commitments.
o Reward improvements in corporate water performance.
o Increase water-related transparency.
o Provide evidence to support the creation of more effective policy responses.","CDP, OECD, Water Footprint Network, with support & engagement from their respective partners and networks",Goal 6,"6.3, 6.4, 6.6, 6.a","Sun, 01/01/2023 - 12:00","Sun, 04/30/2023 - 12:00",,0.5,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16483516483516544

            A publicly available global dataset of corporate opportunities and an accompanying online tracking mechanism.","CDP’s Water Security programme benefits a wide array of stakeholders, from the data providers themselves, to data users and policymakers, all of whom can use CDP data and insights to inform action and track progress towards delivering water security objectives. We aim to contribute to the Water Action Agenda by putting our data at the disposal of national and international policymakers, academics, NGOs, Central Banks and Financial Institutions. In this respect, we have established data partnerships with hundreds of institutions including the UN system, which uses the environmental data reported by companies, cities, states and regions though CDP to compile the UNFCCC Global Climate Action Portal, the Net-Zero Data Public Utility (NZDPU) and track non –state actor progress in the Race to Zero and Race to Resilience.",Ibero-American Network of Life Cycle Assesment,Global,"The private sector is riding the wave of water-related opportunity.  
Through innovation, collaboration and transformation, companies are positioning themselves for success in a world with new water realities, growing regulatory pressures and changing consumer behaviour.  
1,729 companies reporting via CDP, including H&M, Microsoft, Proctor & Gamble and Ford, have committed to invest in 2,719 water-related opportunities that could have a substantive financial or strategic impact on their business and the wider world. The combined financial value of these opportunities is US$436 billion.  A third of these are currently being acted on, 40% will be realized in the next one to three years, and the rest will take more than three years to accomplish. 
Opportunities with the highest financial impact relate to the development of low-water impact products and services. For companies to continue to thrive, the goods they provide will need to be fully aligned with a water-secure future. The water intensity and polluting potential across entire lifecycles will have to be designed out completely, or at least drastically minimized.  From permeable concrete to washing-up liquid, sugar to bank loans, 40% of companies reporting via CDP are identifying, innovating, and introducing new products and services to business customers and individual consumers.  
Across every industry, companies have committed to water-related opportunities linked to efficiency, markets, products and services and resilience. These are helping companies tap into new markets, boost production capacity, build resilience, and gain competitive advantage or access to credit. These opportunities are also the basis for transformation of economies and societies – through the creation of new products and services with lower water impacts, domestic and business customers alike will benefit from day-to-day activities that no longer expose them to water-related risks but actually enhance their own resilience. 
Through the quantity and variety of water-related opportunities being disclosed across every sector and continent, it is clear that the private sector is committed to move the dial on water.  
This sends a strong signal to national governments that there has never been a better time for ambitious, global action to solve the water crisis. We need Heads of State to push for bold water policies, and mandate water disclosure, to provide companies with the incentives, clarity and confidence they need to unlock further investment in water solutions.","In addition to direct monetary benefits, seizing water-related opportunities is enabling companies to develop business models that are fit for the future and hence protect jobs. In addition, they also contribute to direct reductions in their own water impacts as well as those of their customers, having direct positive consequences for communities and ecosystems. 
By decreasing dependencies on water throughout the value chain, protecting rivers, lakes, and streams from pollution and ensuring access to water, sanitation, and hygiene services (WASH), all opportunities reported play a vital role in stemming the water crisis.  
But of course, it doesn’t stop there. Water is the bloodstream of the biosphere, so actions to tackle the water crisis have an impact multiplier effect, resulting in a broader set of benefits for public health, poverty alleviation, jobs, food security, climate mitigation and adaptation, biodiversity, and the protection of ecosystems. 
At CDP, we are committed to increasing our focus on incentivising tens of thousands of companies to align their business models, goods and services with the achievement of a water secure world over the next 8 years and as such, we expect to see a flood of new water smart products enter the markets. For example, CDP collects this data on behalf of more than 640 financial institutions controlling more than $130 trillion in assets under management. By showcasing to them what is possible, putting this data in their hands and rewarding those firms pursuing innovative opportunities, we expect to see a radical increase in the number and variety of water smart opportunities emerging.",,"Goal 2, Goal 6, Goal 8, Goal 9, Goal 11, Goal 12, Goal 15, Goal 17","2.4 , 6.3, 6.4, 9.2 , 12.6, 12.7, 15.1, 17.14, 17.17","Tue, 11/01/2022 - 12:00","Sun, 12/31/2028 - 12:00",https://youtu.be/BaXzsA-dfrs,0.25,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

However, an extensive analysis carried out by the UNESCO World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP) together with a group of about 50 experts from UN Agencies, governmental water offices from Member States, universities and NGOs, has shown that progress towards the realization of these global promises is off track. Indeed, the analysis shows that gender inequalities in the water domain are severe and persist at all levels.
On this behalf, and in alignment with the UNESCO Gender Equality Priority, UNESCO WWAP is coordinating a global Call for Action ‘Accelerating gender equality in the water domain: bridging the data gap and developing concrete actions’.
The scope of this Initiative is to bring attention to the need of accelerating gender equality and the empowerment of women in the water domain, as well as to encourage the development and implementation of gender-inclusive strategies. This initiative therefore calls upon decision-makers, political leaders, governors and policy-makers, financers, CEOs and other relevant actors to accelerate concrete actions towards the achievement of: water access to all without discrimination; promoting women’s leadership in water management and governance; protecting women’s water rights and applying gender-equal financing, narrowing the gender gap between policy and practice, prioritizing the collection of sex-disaggregated water data and counter-fighting norms and stereotypes that disadvantage women and girls.
This Call for Action Initiative is based on three main pillars (https://bit.ly/AcceleratingGenderEquality):
1.	A factual basis formed by an in-depth analysis document ‘Taking Stock of the Progress towards Gender Equality in the Water Domain -  Where do we stand 25 years after the Beijing Declaration?’;
2.	Concrete recommendations for action contained in a joint Position Paper ‘Accelerating Gender Equality in the Water Domain – A Call For Action’ by UNESCO WWAP and a Multi-Stakeholder Coalition, to the attention of leaders and other relevant stakeholders;
3.	Awareness and Dissemination: Spreading the word on the Initiative, its key findings and recommendations is critical for reaching as many stakeholders as possible, ensuring widespread support and action at regional and local levels in order to catalyse progress in the field. To that end, the Call for Action Initiative seeks the support of a broad multi-stakeholder network, and a broad dissemination of the initiative across the public.
To amplify the resonance of this critical Call, the Initiative is supported by a broad ‘Multi-stakeholder Coalition’ consisting of –but not limited to- UN agencies, international and regional organizations, Member States’ institutions, funding agencies, ODAs, NGOs, private sector and civil society. In order to join the Multi-Stakeholder Coalition, it suffices to send an email to the dedicated email address: waterandgendercallforaction@unesco.org, with the expression of interest.","The Call for Action Initiative has been launched at global level in August 2021 at the SIWI World Water Week and will culminate into 2030, coinciding with the completion date of the Agenda 2030 for Sustainable Development. Two important milestones are: i) the Mid-term review of the International Water Action Decade in 2023 and the related UN Conference planned at the UN headquarters in New York, and ii) the completion of the International Water Decade 2018-2028.
The Call for Action advocates for bold actions to accelerate the equitable access to water resources and water services, becoming inclusive and sustainable. These actions should trigger the necessary cultural changes for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of women in the water domain by 2030. Therefore, the Initiative is closely linked to the implementation of the SDG, in particular, SDG 5 and SDG 6, but also attending to relevant inter-linkages with the other Goals.","A Multi-stakeholder Coalition conformed by Member States’ institutions, international and regional organizations, funding agencies and ODAs, NGOs, private sector and civil society, academia and others.

Bangladesh and Eastern India sit atop the Ganges Delta which effectively has a naturally occurring aquifer that has arsenic fluoride and other impurities. After BD’s independence organizations drilled over 10 million tube wells without testing the water.
By 2000 they found 30% of the water was contaminated with Arsenic. That’s what led the world health organization to state this was the biggest mass poisoning in history. All of this could have been prevented if the areas were tested. Decades later the nations face adverse challenges in assessing critical water resources which has severe implications for the health of people and overall infrastructure leading to poor water quality and scarcity.  As waterborne outbreaks continue to be a common norm, Dhaka WASA the world's 2nd largest public water utility in terms of house connections is the authority responsible for managing sewerage and catering supply of 20M+ residents residing in the Capital and has a maximum capacity of sampling 500 lab tests per month.
Challenges
Strict regulations and long procurement cycles across the water industry make it extremely difficult to operate. Federal agencies adopt solutions only after the technology has been widely stress-tested in every facet of operations and only after it becomes an absolute necessity. History suggests “Death by Pilot demonstration” has been the common outcome of water-tech startups. 
Hydroquo+ Bangladesh’s first up-start to have successfully premiered a  pilot concept and scaled to ADB & JICA Financed multi-year federal contracts with the world's 2nd largest public water utility in terms of house connections supplying to 20m+. The same agency that once struggled to supply water is leveraging Hydroquo+’s expertise to ensure water security for its users.  
What We Do
Founded in 2019, Hydroquo+ has worked tirelessly to transform the water industry with the goal of making water safer and sustainable for today and for future generations. Hydroqup+ has automated mission-critical testing and monitoring processes that were traditionally manual, slow, and expensive.
Hydroquo+  has addressed these issues by developing an innovative solution that delivers a vertically integrated water quality and monitoring platform with intelligent hardware and software expertise. Real-time testing and monitoring that addresses both water efficiency (leak detection and usage) and water quality (safety and composition), ultimately increasing overall water availability. With the power of actionable and predictive water intelligence on a global scale, Hydroquo+ seeks to solve a number of the world’s water challenges with the goal of preserving this quintessential resource for years to come.
Our solution has enabled water operators to be able to correlate data with several planning models, understand consumer behavior, and understand forecasting patterns for custom operations. As a result, they can identify and get ahead of the issues before they become real concerns including potential compliance issues, maintenance requirements, water usage, and water quality anomalies.","Hydroquo+ has automated high-frequency testing fundamentally reducing the cost per sample. D’WASA required 7200 samples per month /Area for (Ph, Turbidity, Total Dissolved Solids, Dissolved Oxygen, Salinity, Total Organic Carbon, Dissolved Organic Carbon, Free Chlorine, and Residual Chlorine) at two minutes per day. Using sample schedules and the monthly cost of the Hydroquo+ solution the sample can be calculated at USD 0.01.

Investor signatories to the VWFI recognize that companies have the potential to better steward and protect freshwater resources within their business operations and global supply chains to drive meaningful, global change. The initiative includes 85 investor signatories representing approximately $14 trillion in assets under management. The initiative is informed by a set of clear action steps called the Corporate Expectations for Valuing Water. This set of six, science-based, actionable expectations provide investors with the framework to inform their engagements to move companies to strategically address water risk, aligning with the United Nation’s 2030 Sustainable Development Goal for Water (SDG6).  
To inform investor engagements and to ensure that companies advance toward ambitious water stewardship actions, Ceres will assess and track progress on the water risk management practices of companies that align with the Corporate Expectations. Specifically, the assessment will inform investor dialogues with companies and the overall progress of VWFI by:
-- Assessing alignment and gaps: Provide an assessment of the current alignment of companies to the ambitions in the Corporate Expectations.
-- Informing investor engagement topics: Provide insights into where corporate action is lacking or where new, innovative ambition should be explored.
-- Elevate best practices: Highlight best practices in water stewardship across and within sectors which can help illuminate opportunities for companies to elevate their ambitions to reduce their water risk.
-- Tracking company progress: Serve as a tool for tracking company progress on the Corporate Expectations over time. Trends gathered will reinforce and clarify how company actions evolve to meet the Corporate Expectations. 
The VWFI is facilitated by Ceres as the Secretariat and guided by a group of 12 investors representing 7 countries (The Valuing Water Finance Task Force). VWFI was launched in partnership with the Government of the Netherlands.","The overarching goal of the Valuing Water Finance Initiative is that companies recognize freshwater as the world’s most precious natural resource, essential to whole industries and all communities and ecosystems. As a result of the investor-led Valuing Water Finance Initiative engagements with companies, investors anticipate companies will advance their water stewardship actions in order to reduce their water risk. Specifically, the investor signatories to the Valuing Water Finance Initiative will work with companies towards tangible improvements in corporate water stewardship through the following Corporate Expectations framework :
-- Water Quantity: Companies do not negatively impact water availability in water-scarce areas across their value chain.
-- Water Quality: Companies do not negatively impact water quality across their value chain.
-- Ecosystem Protection: Companies do not contribute to the conversion of natural ecosystems critical to freshwater supplies and aquatic biodiversity and actively work to restore degraded habitats that their businesses depend upon.
-- Access to Water and Sanitation: Companies contribute to the social, economic and ecological resilience of communities they interact with by contributing to achieving universal and equitable access to WASH across their value chain.
-- Board Oversight: Corporate boards and senior management oversee water management efforts.
-- Public Policy Engagement: Companies ensure that all public policy engagement and lobbying activities are aligned with sustainable water resource management outcomes.","ASR Asset Management, Aberdeen Standard Investments, Achmea Investment Management, ACTIAM, Adrian Dominican Sisters, AJF Capital Management, Amundi Asset Management, As You Sow, AustralianSuper Pty Ltd, Aviva Investors, Bailard, La Banke Postale Asset Management, BMO Global Asset Management, Bon Secours Mercy Health, Boston Common Asset Management, Breckinridge Capital Advisors, CalPERs, California State Controller's Office, CalSTRs, Cathay Financial Holdings, Cathay Life, Cetera, Change Finance, Christian Brothers Investment Services, ClearBridge Investments, CommonSpirit Health, Congregation of St. Joseph, Dana Investment Advisors, Daughters of Charity - Province of St. Louise, DNB Asset Management, The Episcopal Church (DFMS), Dominican Sisters - Grand Rapids, Downing LLP, DWS Group, East Bay Municipal Utility District, Environment Agency Pension Fund, Ethical Partners Funds Management, Ethos Engagement Pool International, Ethos Foundation, Federated Hermes.

The reserve spans over 700 km of free-flowing rivers, boasting an outstanding natural and cultural heritage of Europe and the world. This biosphere reserve (BR) is rich in rare habitats and it’s the home for many endangered species. However, many of these today threatened due to the declining state of the water and its surrounding floodplain ecosystems. 
The objective of this commitment is the improvement in ecosystem restoration management in the UNESCO Mura River Biosphere Reserve, which is also part of the TBR MDD. The objectives of the latter are common in Slovenia as well as in the remaining four countries. 
The objective of the Slovenian UNESCO Mura River Biosphere Reserve management authority - Ministry of Natural Resources and Spatial Planning of the Republic of Slovenia regarding the key points of the Water Convention is taking measures on transboundary Mura River (including its border section with Austria and Croatia) to ensure ecologically reliable water management, conservation of resources and environmental protection, focusing on restoration of river and floodplain ecosystems, where necessary. 
In the past, Slovenia has advocated for a restored, dynamic and ecologically connected Mura River system in several national and transboundary agendas and documents:
•	The ""Declaration concerning common approaches to water management, flood protection, hydropower utilization and nature and biodiversity conservation in the Drava River basin"", signed as a signal for full support at the Drava River Vision Symposium, Maribor, 24 September 2008,
•	The Ministerial Declaration on the preparation of the establishment of the ,,Mura–Drava-Danube Transboundary Biosphere Reserve"" (MDD-TBR), signed by the Environment Ministers of all five countries in 2011;
•	The ""Assessment of the River and Floodplain Restoration Potential in the Transboundary UNESCO Biosphere Reserve ""Mura-Drava-Danube"" in 2013,
•	The Cooperation Agreement among the coop MDD partnership and managing institutions of Protected Areas forming part of the TBR MDD"" (2018) including Action Plan for Habitat Restoration in Natura 2000 Site Mura (SI)and other.
•	The establishment of BR along Mura, Drava, Danube in Croatia and Hungary (2012), Serbia (2017), Slovenia (2018), Austria (2019) and the TBR MDD in 2021
•	The Common Work Plan for the 5-country BR as defined in the TBR MDD nomination form for UNESCO (2019);
•	The Ministerial Declaration to UNESCO on the Support of the Establishment of the ""5-country Biosphere Reserve Mura-Drava-Danube"", signed by the Environment Ministers of all five countries in 2020;
•	The ""Danube Declaration"" 2022 -2027 of the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River (endorsed at the 4th Ministerial Meeting held on 8/2/2022) and the Danube River Basin Management Plan Update 2021.
•	Outputs developed in the lifelineMDD project in 2022:  River Restoration Toolbox, Synthesis report on science-based needs for action, River Restoration Strategy.
As a follow-up to the existing agreements, we, therefore, add this commitment for the implementation of necessary measures to achieve these goals.","In line with the above-mentioned documents, we propose our commitment to active managed Mura River Biosphere Reserve and to restored, dynamic and ecologically connected Mura River system, as stated in the “lifelineMDD River Restoration Strategy: A commitment for future restoration works in the 5-country Biosphere Reserve Mura-Drava-Danube (TBR MDD)”.

Successful proposals will deliver direct support to vulnerable populations at scale while advancing one or more of the targets of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal 6.
The IBM Sustainability Accelerator will provide support to five selected organization, that will make up a cohort, for up to two years. During this timeframe, IBM will follow a comprehensive approach with each selected nonprofit or government organization, delivering user centered design, development, technical solutions, custom tools, scientific expertise, and mentorship while building community among the participants.
Phase 1 – Ideation: Accelerator engagements will kick off with the IBM Garage, IBM’s proven methodology to apply design thinking and agile techniques to fast-track meaningful innovation and drive lasting culture change. During this process, IBM experts will work with the beneficiary organization to rapidly identify their needs, understand the end user, and establish a clear roadmap to design, develop, deploy, and continually improve technology to solve specific public challenges. Specifically, the IBM Garage is a collaborative approach that brings together IBM
designers, architects, and developers with participating organizations to pitch, prototype and produce side-by-side to help transform organizations from the inside out. 
Phase 2 – Development and Implementation: Based on the analysis and roadmaps established in Phase 1, IBM experts will configure IBM resources and technology to help participants meet their community and environmental impact goals. The projects will include the deployment of existing technologies or proven methodologies and the development of customized solutions that will help the organizations to scale their operations. IBM experts will then support pilot deployments of Accelerator-supported solutions to facilitate optimal implementation, sustainable use by the organization, and opportunities to further scale impact benefitting communities and society.
Wherever possible, projects will be delivered with local resources, in local languages and through local IBMers. This brings IBM closer to the needs of organizations and their stakeholders, enabling IBM to provide field-ready assets to support local communities
and produce local outcomes.","The IBM Sustainability Accelerator’s new water management cohort will accelerate SDG implementation by scaling technology solutions that address water-related issues by supporting availability and sound management of water and sanitation for vulnerable communities. To ensure that projects are successful during their time in the Accelerator and beyond, the selection criteria will take into account the applicant’s capacity and readiness to support communities who are especially vulnerable to water-related threats, technical feasibility and sustainability for the envisioned solution, and transparency on measurement and reporting, among others.
The Accelerator already has a track record of interlinking SDGs. Aligning with SDG 17 – Partnerships for the Goals, the IBM Sustainability Accelerator benefits from support from Strategic Allies, a variety of organizations and experts aligned to the IBM Sustainability Accelerator mission of innovating and scaling solutions for sustainability for underserved communities. These organizations are part of the program’s broad ecosystem that offers participants and projects additional subject matter and technical expertise. From innovation investments to support in the selection of new cohorts, these strategic alliances enrich and add value to the engagement of participating organizations. 
The Accelerator’s first cohort focused on Sustainable Agriculture, SDG 2.4.1, and projects with two of our beneficiaries – Deltares and Texas A&M AgriLife, interlink with SDGs 6.3 and 6.4 respectively. Our second cohort’s focus is SDG 7 Clean Energy, and our project with Sustainable Energy for All has components related to SDG 3. 
While we do not yet know the projects that will ultimately be selected for the new water management cohort, we will continue to seek ways where water management interconnects with other SDGs. Potential projects could include:
•	Anticipating water shortages and infrastructure outage-inducing storms which interlinks with SDG 9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation
•	Reducing water pollution which interlinks with SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages as well as SDG 15 (Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss) as runoffs from polluted sources of water can affect life on land and biodiversity
•	Contributing water management research to provide underserved communities with critically needed water access or protection of reservoirs which interlinks with SDGs 10: Reduce inequality within and among countries
•	Increasing availability to safe drinking water and improved hygiene and water quality interlinks with SDG 3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages and SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls","Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ)

The program is implemented with the support of four local partners in India, Nepal, and Uganda, and with the backing of two members from the German WASH network. In India, the program is being implemented by UNNATI in Jodhpur Municipality, Rajasthan; in Nepal, RSDC intervenes in the Sarlahi and Mahottari Districts; and in Uganda, Cafomi and Viva con Agua Uganda work in Ntoroko and Bundibugyo Districts. Many people still don't have access to basic services. This is due to systemic challenges, a lack of action on putting the human rights to water and sanitation into practice, as well as a lack of personal and financial resources, and the fact that the rights holders are not the main focus. To address this, various approaches are being implemented globally, including Making Rights Real (MRR) and WASH Systems Strengthening. MRR aims to motivate leaders in local government to make more meaningful progress, using human rights principles. But broader improvements in the WASH system are also necessary. WASH Systems Strengthening analyzes existing gaps and develops roadmaps for improvement. However, for a better understanding of where improvements are needed, decision-makers need to take action. With years of experience in the WASH sector, Malteser International, WASH United, and GTO have developed a program concept of a new methodology that combines both MRR and WASH Systems Strengthening. An external feasibility study showed the potential, feasibility, and scalability of the programme, which was then developed by all partners through a collaborative and iterative process on virtual multi-stakeholder platforms.","2.2 billion people worldwide lack access to clean drinking water and 4.2 billion people lack access to safe sanitation, as aimed by SDG 6. Efforts to improve these services have been ongoing, but the challenge is mainly due to persistent inequalities, and lack of sustainability and functionality of services. The conscious use of the human rights to water and sanitation can change this. The international community used to provide infrastructure support to countries, but this has proven unsustainable. The current trend is to help governments improve their capacity to provide sustainable services, but this often requires overcoming financial and capacity gaps, as well as involving rights holders in decision-making. In India, the project supports 26 Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) in Jodhpur, Rajasthan, to improve WASH services for the under-served population in informal settlements. It will also seek to improve the working situation and social security of a very vulnerable and excluded group of rag (waste) pickers and sewerage ‘manhole’ workers in the service delivery chain who many a times face gross human rights violations. India has a long history of policy making on water and sanitation and the ULBs are responsible for the planning, implementation and delivery of services. The project hopes to help bridge the gap between policy and implementation. In Nepal, the project aims to support two rural municipalities namely, Dhankaul of Sarlahi District and Samsi of Mahottari District and two municipalities namely Balara of Sarlahi District and Manara Siswa of Mahottari district to improve WASH systems, mostly by planning and preparation of the Nepal WASH Development plan. The project strengthens the capacity of the Local Government stakeholders on realizing the human rights to WASH services and bridge the gap in planning and implementation of WASH activities. Likewise, the project also assists the local government to develop policies related to participatory accountability and establish a feedback mechanism. In Uganda, District WASH Plans that integrate human rights are developed to understand the WASH services gaps, budgets, and institutional capacities needed for sustainable access to WASH services for all. Communities in the two pilot districts are activated and understand and demand their rights to water and sanitation services. Overall aim of the program in Uganda is supporting strengthened WASH systems to deliver sustainable WASH services for all in the two pilot districts. Best practices, lessons learned, and case studies are documented by local partners, MI, GTO, and WASH United, and co-authored by government representatives at various levels from India, Nepal, and Uganda. GTO, WASH United, and MI will leverage their strong relationships with partners around the world and facilitate the sharing of findings at international WASH forums to inspire and motivate other countries to adopt the approach to improving water and sanitation as a human right for all. The results of this research will form the basis for further promoting and scaling up initiatives aimed at inspiring a broader global network to realize human rights through strengthened WASH systems in other countries.","UNNATI India, RSDC Nepal, Cafomi and Viva con Agua Uganda, German Toilet Organization, WASH United, Institute for Sustainable Futures","Goal 3, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 10, Goal 11","3.3, 5.c , 6.1 , 6.2, 6.b , 10.2, 11.1 , 11.3, 11.6","Wed, 06/01/2022 - 12:00","Sat, 05/31/2025 - 12:00",https://www.malteser-international.org/en/current-issues/our-response/water-and-hygiene.html,0.375,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.16483516483516544

1.	Understanding that agriculture accounts (on average) for 70% of all freshwater withdrawals globally, we will continue improving productivity in water scarce regional cropping systems – starting with rice, where we commit to improve water use per kg of crop by 25% in 2030 by transforming the rice cropping system for smallholder farmers in the relevant regions where Bayer operates.  In addition, our existing commitment of reducing the environmental impact of our crop protection portfolio by 30% in 2030 also contributes to water quality.
2.	Develop a methodology to value water and incorporate water quality into investment processes and incorporate water quality and quantity into business decisions and investment, starting in 2024. Ensure that other sites located in areas endangered by water scarcity will optimize the use of water, setting by 2025 context relevant water targets like reduction / reuse or water quality and engage our suppliers with our updated Supplier Code of Conduct that includes strengthened and dedicated topics addressing water and wastewater. 
3.	Cooperate with the WRC to support collective action in watersheds with the aim to invest in high-stress basins to increase water availability & quality, prioritizing climate positive approaches as one main impact. Participate as a private sector representative with the WMO Water and Climate Leaders ensuring resilient water-adaptation in the face of climate change to integrate climate and water targets into global water policy.","Bayer’s new strategy takes account of Bayer’s position as a systemic player in health and agriculture and aims to achieve impact beyond Bayer’s own operations. Bayer continues to contribute to a more water resilient agriculture, starting with rice, the third most important crop in agriculture after wheat and maize. Half of the world’s population rely on rice, which has a huge water footprint: it represents up to 30% of the world’s total water withdrawals, as well as 12% of total global methane emissions. In Asia, cultivating rice accounts for up to 50% of all freshwater withdrawals. Bayer’s commitment to improve water use per kilogramme of rice crop by 25% by 2030 therefore strives to create significant impact at scale, helping to achieve not only SDG6 but also SDG2 and SDG 13.

Main objective of this initiative is to showcase how societies in these countries can benefit from new microsatellite technologies and how space born data can be applied to Digital Twin Models in order to analyze sensitivities of multi-physics and multi-scale interactions in River Basin Eco-systems.
The initiative stems from the successful results of Space-SI project Nemo-RBS for European Space Agency in the scope of Future EO – Science for Society programme dedicated to the advanced microsatellite technologies for agile scanning of river basins which are capable of accurate tracking of river paths in order to acquire high resolution multispectral images and video data for water surfaces and land-use including information about water quality, state of vegetation, urban infrastructure, maritime traffic as well as many other aspects important for river basin monitoring and management. 
Space-SI has developed several successful technology demonstration cases by using Nemo-HD microsatellite for Soča, Sava, Drina and Danube rivers in Alpine, Ionian-Adriatic and Danube EU macro-regions. The new technologies are now being transferred and tested in India in collaboration with cGanga Centre for Ganga River Basin Management and Studies and Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in the scope of Ganga and Sava River Twinning initiative.
The goal of this international cooperation is to extend the Twinning programme for sharing knowledge, showcasing the Satellite Technologies and assessing Digital Twin Models to a global level where the worldwide efforts will be led by Indian partners with an ambition to form at least 22 twinning programmes including transboundary source to sea (S2S) streams in Europe, Asia, Africa, Nord and Latin Americas as well as Caribbean countries in 2023-2028 period. 
To facilitate dissemination of scientific and technological results and to enrich communications with beneficiaries new approaches employing symbolic language of art will be developed in order to sensitize all stakeholders including public at large about the vital importance and value of advanced ecosystem services for river basins and our well-being on global scale.","Enable more sustainable management of water resources (SDG 6)

CLI is a facilitated process that provides resources and expertise to support Indigenous and municipal elected leaders as they find solutions to shared water challenges. The CLI process seeks to build trust and relationships, transform decision-making processes and institutions, and achieve tangible outcomes related to the stewardship of shared lands and waters at the community level.
Drawing on decades of research and work with communities, the CLI model enables the creation of collaborative, enduring governance tables based on reconciliation between Indigenous and municipal elected decision makers. By working with these leaders to establish the foundation for long-term collaboration, CLI produces a permanent forum for the expression of Indigenous and local rights and knowledge that reduces conflict and improves decision-making.
CLI invests time and resources in developing relationships between leaders. Through a series of facilitated, interactive gatherings, Indigenous and municipal leaders work together to build trust and understanding, dispel misconceptions, and establish pathways for working together. By acknowledging the individuals at the table – and transforming the way they relate to one another – the CLI process establishes the foundation for governance reform.
Since 2017, CIER and our partners – the Winnipeg Metropolitan Region and Southern Chiefs’ Organization –  have implemented the CLI model to address key water challenges in Manitoba, Canada. The CLI Manitoba project demonstrated that establishing a shared space and a structured collaboration process with Indigenous and municipal leaders can transform governance at the local level where most water decisions are made. Through CIER’s people-centered and community-led design, the CLI model shows potential for creating lasting behavior changes, enabling leaders to make better decisions and achieve better water stewardship outcomes over time. 
Building on the success of CLI Manitoba, this project will implement the CLI model in at least four new locations across Canada. It will also aim to create an enabling environment for the acceleration of collaborative water governance through knowledge mobilization, legislative and policy change, and leveraging new resources.","This initiative will foster the creation of new collaborative governance tables in which Indigenous and municipal government leaders work together to implement innovative solutions to shared water challenges. Each table will embed formal and informal collaboration between leaders, their staff, and their communities, helping to ensure long-term sustainability. Collaboration at the CLI table will enable Indigenous and municipal communities to work together to protect and manage their waters (SDG 6), particularly in the face of a climate-impacted future (SDG 13). They will do so according to their own knowledge systems, needs, and values. Outcomes achieved at the CLI table will have broader benefits for the health of the entire watershed, including terrestrial ecosystems (SDG 15). More broadly, the strong relationships and improved governance mechanisms established at the CLI table will allow Indigenous and municipal leaders to continue making good decisions at the local level over a range of shared priorities (SDG 16).",Indigenous and municipal governments across Canada,"Goal 6, Goal 13, Goal 15, Goal 16","6.5, 6.6, 6.b , 13.1, 13.3, 15.1, 16.6, 16.7","Mon, 09/20/2021 - 12:00","Tue, 06/30/2026 - 12:00","Background information: https://yourcier.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/CLI-backgrounderNEW-1.p…

This challenges assessment and management, as reflected in the updated HELCOM Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP 2021) as a key component for achieving good status is how substances are managed throughout their life cycle. The Baltic Sea regional framework for hazardous substances has been based on limited priority contaminants, ad hoc work and outdated HELCOM Recommendations on industrial releases of substances. Developing a holistic and coordinated approach to address contamination of marine environment of the Baltic Sea is included in the 2021 Baltic Sea Action Plan (action HL1) and the project HAPhazard was launched in 2022 to implement this. 
Mapping and reviewing of the policies relevant for the Baltic Sea and also current HELCOM tools that are available is conducted. A scheme for the new regional holistic framework, along with the requirements for the individual tools (e.g. substance prioritization mechanism), as well as for the interactions with other policies that can serve it are developed. The new HELCOM framework should live in harmony with other policies, while achieving extra benefit for the Baltic Sea as necessary (i.e., addressing needs towards fulfilling the BSAP goal for hazardous substances, not being addressed by the existing policies – or addressed with delay). Its design will:
- facilitate identification of substances, sources, and pathways of the highest regional relevance, now and in the future;
- enable adoption of measures with clear added value on the top of – and in synergy with – the existing policy landscape; promote measures that would be targeted, efficient and effective in improving and protecting the state of Baltic Sea;
- promote utilization of all relevant information on hazardous substances and recognition of key information gaps; a different kind of measures (from the above) will target filling of these information gaps.","The potential impacts of a well-structured holistic regional hazardous substances strategy and action plan coupled to suitable assessment tools providing early warning signals is huge. It has the potential to react rapidly to pressures and address them before serious environmental degradation occurs, thus the protective effect is significantly more efficient compared to restoration or damage limitation actions (SDG 3.9, 6.3, 6.5, 6.6). 
The new holistic regional hazardous substances strategy and action plan will review existing information and develop an approach that considers hazardous substances across their lifecycle/management cycle in the Baltic Sea region (12.4, 17.14). Constructing such a strategic approach will also clarify sources and pathways, reflect on appropriate use and disposal, and identify the need for improved assessment that can better judge the status of the environment – in particular where biodiversity is clearly impacted but none of the obvious contaminants are found alone at damaging levels (6.6, 14.1., 15.1).",HELCOM Contracting Parties: 9 countries and the European Union,"Goal 3, Goal 6, Goal 12, Goal 14, Goal 15, Goal 17","3.9, 6.3, 6.5, 6.6, 12.4, 14.1, 15.1, 17.14","Sat, 10/01/2022 - 12:00","Thu, 10/31/2024 - 12:00","Background report on an update of HELCOM work on hazardous substances in the Baltic Sea (BSEP 182, HELCOM 2021): https://helcom.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Background-report-on-an-up…

            Reward improvements in FIs water performance","CDP´s programme on increasing transparency of the financial sector on water started in 2021 and has already produced global evidence on whether and how financial institutions (FIs) disclosure risk, opportunities and impacts on water security. This evidence is already being used in the development of a public interface to present FI water commitments and will be used in future to support the FIs in their transition to a water secure world, and financial regulators on the identification of key metrics for water disclosures.",Ibero-American Network of Life Cycle Assesment,Global,"Finance has been identified as one of the key pillars of the UN Global Acceleration Framework for SDG 6.  Achieving a water secure, net zero economy will require a complete transformation of our global economy. Triggering such a transformation is a game-changer. 
Global financial institutions (FIs) can offer unique, systemic incentives for change by ensuring their investment, insurance, lending, rating and underwriting practices drive these water users to use water wisely, to not pollute water, and to promote its reuse. Banks, shareholders and the FIs that own or lend to them currently enable companies to undertake economic activities, which in many cases are profoundly detrimental to the environment. By asking Fis to be transparent about the water-related risks and impacts that they are exposed to through their financing activities, we seek to reduce the flow of capital to water destructive activities and businesses and increase flow to those that value water appropriately. 
Members of the Network of Central Banks and Supervisors for Greening and Financial Systems (NGFS), and the European Central Bank (ECB) have all acknowledged the need for financial institutions to disclose water-related data however they stop short in recommending exactly what should be reported. The outcome and lessons learned from this work will contribute to dialogues underway between CDP and these important institutions to inform regulatory development. 
Over the last two years CDP developed an initial set of water security indicators that were informed by a technical working group of industry participants; these indicators have since been incorporated into CDP’s questionnaire for the financial sector. From this, we have global evidence from 275 FIs on how they assess water risk and opportunities, define water strategies and engage with companies. In 2023, an invitation to disclose was sent to over 1,200 financial institutions – watch this space!
Our data show that hundreds of financial institutions controlling trillions are acting on water transparency and accountability. 
The evidence that CDP generates from this data is channelled to FIs, public facing resources, and governments to increase their understanding of what is needed to align finance with a water secure world. With hundreds of FIs setting water-related actions, and leading countries updating national Sustainable Development Management plans, the opportunity for greater ambition abounds.  
Already, CDP is close to publishing a public interface to explore the actions that financial institutions are taking to reduce their water impact and become stewards of water resources around the world. This interface is soon to be published on the CDP website to highlight action already being taken and to promote further, more ambitious commitments and actions from financial institutions.","By focusing on financial institutions, this intervention ensures a key accountability lever in the global water sector is activated and empowered to act in line with global ambitions regarding water security. To stem the water security crisis, businesses, which wield control or influence over 70% of the world’s freshwater reserves, must change their approach to how they use and impact upon this resource, in essence, learning to operate differently. Many of these companies are transnational and as such, their growth plans and strategies are beyond the influence of any one national government. So, while national governments can exert control over how a particular factory within its jurisdiction engages with water, it cannot influence the way in which the company that owns 5,000 other factories around the world chooses to respond. It would take a concerted and highly coordinated effort by multiple governments to bring just one firm into line with international water goals. FIs, on the other hand, can and do exert this type of influence, giving them unparalleled potential to shift companies toward a more sustainable future. They also have the potential to significantly influence the course the corporate sector takes on exposure and vulnerability to water risks, and water stewardship. 
Through this initiative, we expect to make governments, regulators and FIs aware on the actions that are underway and understand what more is needed to align finance with a water secure world.",,"Goal 6, Goal 8, Goal 9, Goal 12, Goal 17","6.3, 6.4, 8.4, 8.10, 12.2, 12.4, 12.6, 17.3","Tue, 06/01/2021 - 12:00","Sun, 12/31/2028 - 12:00","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaXzsA-dfrs

The Sava FFWS is the common platform, strongly contributing to national hydro-meteorological services and flood emergency authorities, ensuring improved preparedness and optimized flood risk mitigation measures. The Sava FFWS supports competent authorities in taking balanced decisions in flood emergency situations, and carrying out measures to prevent and mitigate severe flood events, based on accurate forecasts. The successful establishment and functioning of the Sava FFWS is based on the support and outstanding cooperation of all relevant stakeholders in the basin.  The global scale uniqueness of the Sava FFWS is reflected in the fact that the designed system structure (1 central host and 3 back-ups in 4 countries) greatly contributes to the sense of ownership and shared responsibility for its functioning.
During the successful operation, the possibilities for enhancement of the modelling tools for more accurate flood forecasts are recognized. In addition to flood forecasting and warning improvements, the Sava FFWS will be, in its second phase of development, significantly extended, upgraded with capabilities to provide clearer insight into low flow conditions, and will function as an auxiliary tool for various water management purposes. 
With better flood and low flow forecasting and warning capabilities, the Sava FFWS will be an essential tool in preparation of reliable scenarios to mitigate harmful consequences of extreme events to population and water dependent sectors e.g. navigation, agriculture, hydropower production and environment.
The system will bridge the gaps in existing drought monitoring (and risk estimation) tools, which in most of the countries lack low flows forecasting and warning systems, ensuring in response to drought, much clearer inter-institutional scheme of data, responsibilities and communication on the transboundary basin level.  
Ambitions to achieve:
-	The Sava River Basin would be less vulnerable to extreme flow conditions by, inter alia, focusing on integrated water resources management and transboundary cooperation on flood and drought monitoring and mitigation, thereby making the countries more resilient to climate shocks. It would enable risk reduction of human lives' loss,  damaged infrastructure, detrimental impacts on environment and cultural heritage, economic losses, and would increase resilience of communities, and social wellbeing.
The ambitions will be achieved by:
•	Upgrading the flow forecasting platform through improvement of modelling tools to represent more accurate flood and low flow conditions.
•	Supporting enhanced warning system with a regionally harmonized procedures and innovative warning products.
•	Supporting advanced capacity development for relevant actors on water-related data, including the earth observations using the remote sensing, and modelling tools.
•	Giving emphasis on international and multi-sectoral stakeholder involvement, enhancing co creational approach, opportunities, identifying synergies and promoting transboundary solutions.
•	Creating momentum for further advancements of the basin wide cooperation mechanisms of the ISRBC.
•	Demonstrating and promoting the benefits of effective strategic regional dialogue for the sustainable development in the Sava River Basin.","The initiative will significantly contribute to:
- Further strengthening of the well-established cooperation mechanism of the ISRBC for integrated water resources management through transboundary cooperation in the Sava River Basin, developed as an effective, accountable and transparent organization, which enable inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making of all the members (SDG 6.5, 16.6 and 16.7).
- Strengthening the resilience and adaptive capacity to water related climate- hazards and natural disasters by enhancing the flow forecasting and warning tools and procedures in all Sava River Basin countries, taking into account current climate variability and future climate change. Contributing to the awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on water related climate change adaptation measures, impact reduction, forecasting and early warning. Actions will enable risk reduction of human lives' loss, damages of properties and infrastructure, detrimental impacts on environment and cultural heritage, economic losses, and will increase resilience of communities, and wellbeing of the whole society (SDGs 13.1, 13.3, 11.5, 11.b).
- Promoting the use of advanced and innovative information technologies to be more prepared for different flow related risks in the transboundary Sava River Basin. (SDG 17.8).
- Creating possibilities to knowledge, information and experience transfer among wider or different regions creating the possibilities for integration within the framework of macro-regional strategies and dissemination of the lessoned learnt with other international basins.","Global Environmental Facility

Global community (indirect)",Italy,Europe,"The specific objective of the project is to complete and strengthen the framework of knowledge on rivers, lakes and ground waters of the Italian territory in order to understand the dynamics that prevent the achievement of good status of our water bodies. The good health of water bodies is in fact a strategic objective within European Union, but also a fundamental element for achieving universal access to water envisaged by SDG 6 and the related targets.
The implementation methodology envisages that the Basin Authorities carry out, in partnership with the main national scientific institutions, research activities to fill the knowledge gap and enhance the water quality and quantity monitoring activities of the basin in order to achieve the quality objectives of the bodies of water envisaged by Directive 2000/60/EC (Water Framework Directive).
The universities and the most prestigious national research centers also collaborate in the implementation of the project, in order to involve the best available scientific expertise and introduce the most recent innovations in the field of water resource monitoring and management processes.
The committed resources will enable to identify new methodological criteria, to strengthen advanced monitoring systems and to create models capable of best describing the hydraulic functioning and dispersion of pollutants, in surface and ground water bodies.
In addition, actions aimed at preparing basin hydrological balances, homogeneous on a national scale, and at defining management rules for the use of resources to deal with climate change and water scarcity will be supported. Lastly, interventions for the acquisition of knowledge and the development of management models will be supported in the field of hydrological and morphological alterations, sediment management, rehabilitation, renaturalization and the functional rearrangement of the hydrographic network. This extraordinary investment is also accompanied by a robust commitment to digitizing data and improving the processes of sharing and updating information between the data providers and the decision-makers.","At the end of the project, the different basin authorities and political decision-makers will be able to intervene at a legislative, managerial and operational level to deal with the critical issues that will emerge from a more precise, timely and punctual qualitative and quantitative monitoring of water resources.
The improvement of knowledge and in particular on the pressures that generate the quantitative or qualitative deterioration of water resources, will allow to identify the most suitable, legitimate and sustainable measures (also from an economic point of view) essential for maintaining the availability of quality water even in the long term, at affordable costs. The digitization and data sharing processes will also permit a simpler and more transparent access to information, facilitating the participation of citizens and stakeholders, helping to improve the decision-making process and making the measures, adopted to achieve the SDG 6, more equitable.
Measures appropriate to the short, medium and long-term needs, emerging from the monitoring, may therefore be adopted (limitation of the use of certain pollutants, incentives for good agricultural and/or production practices, adoption of rational irrigation plans and more) with the goal of maintaining and improving the qualitative and quantitative status of Italian water resources.
A better qualitative and quantitative management and protection of water resources will consequently allow:
- A lower influx of pollutants into the Mediterranean Sea by improving the connected water ecosystems (SDG 14.1);
- Better quality and quantity of water for human consumption and sanitation (SDG 6.1, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, SDG 3.3, 3.9);
- The conservation, restoration and sustainable management of water-related terrestrial ecosystems (SDG 15.1);
- A sustainable agricultural and livestock production system and the implementation of better and resilient agricultural practices that allow the maintenance of ecosystems, the increase in productivity and, at the same time, the ability to adapt to climate change, extreme weather events, drought, floods and other disasters (SDG 2.4).","Eastern Alps Basin Authority

The vision of the Nutrient Recycling Strategy is that nutrients are managed sustainably in all HELCOM countries, securing the productivity of agriculture and minimizing nutrient loss to the Baltic Sea environment through efficient use of nutrients and cost-effective nutrient recycling. 
The Strategy includes six objectives: being a model area for nutrient recycling, reducing environmental impacts, safe nutrient recycling, knowledge exchange and awareness raising, creating business opportunities and improving policy coherence. The objectives contain sub-objectives and possible measures to be implemented by the HELCOM Contracting Parties by 2027, and each objective of the Strategy has a prioritized action that is included in the updated BSAP. The 2021 BSAP actions have individual target years, are identified as supporting action or measure, have dedicated criteria for achievement, one or several HELCOM bodies responsible for taking the work on the action forward and are linked to relevant pressures and human activities in the region. The progress of implementation is tracked annually within the regular work of the HELCOM subsidiary bodies as well as with HELCOM Explorer in 2025 and 2029. The effect of implementation is tracked with HELCOM joint monitoring, indicators and assessments.","According to the Baltic Sea Regional Nutrient Recycling Strategy, circular economy is one of the keys to more sustainable production and consumption systems of the future, and agriculture and food production rely on natural resources and cycles (SDG 2.4, 17.14). As demands on natural resources grow, we risk depleting them beyond sustainable limits while simultaneously causing environmental problems due to leakage and loss (13.1, 15.1). We therefore need to be more resource-efficient in the way we use and re-use resources, improving feedback loops and integrating circular economy principles (6.5, 12.5). The recycling of nutrients is an essential element of circular economy and sustainable food production.
Nutrients that have leached into the Baltic Sea cause eutrophication, this is the most serious challenge to the Baltic Sea. Phosphorus and nitrogen are essential nutrients to the growth of plants and the food production. The valuable resources turn into a serious problem, when in the wrong place, in surplus to need, and not efficiently used. There is a need to improve recycling of nutrients on land and to reduce their losses to the sea to minimize the harmful impact on the Baltic Sea (6.3, 6.6, 14.1). The measures in the Strategy help to preserve phosphorus resources for future generations (12.2).
According to the Regional Nutrient Recycling Strategy, in nutrient recycling biomass or other matter containing nutrients is utilized and managed by man so that it will end up back in the cycle for the use of plants (15.3). Recycled matter can be used as such or be processed to products, materials or raw materials. Nutrient recycling and efficient use aim at creating a systemic approach to optimal use of nutrients in plant production while also minimizing nutrient loss in all parts of the food system from field to fork (15.3).",Contracting Parties of HELCOM: 9 countries and the European Union,"Goal 2, Goal 6, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 14, Goal 15, Goal 17","2.4 , 6.3, 6.5, 6.6, 12.2, 12.5, 13.1, 14.1, 15.1, 15.3, 17.14","Thu, 10/21/2021 - 12:00","Fri, 12/31/2027 - 12:00","HELCOM Recommendation 42-43/2, Amendments to Part II Annex III “Criteria and measures concerning the prevention of pollution from land-based sources” of the 1992 Helsinki Convention: https://helcom.fi/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rec-42-43-2.pdf

They are included in the 2021 Baltic Sea Action Plan (BSAP) and part of the follow-up of the revised nutrient reduction scheme included in the BSAP. Currently the Eighth Baltic Sea Pollution Load Compilation (PLC-8) project is ongoing. 
The aim is to estimate input of nutrients and selected hazardous substances to the Baltic Sea as well as apportionment of their sources. HELCOM coordinates the data collection and preparation of assessments, the nine Contracting Parties (countries) are responsible to organize the monitoring. The methods are harmonized and data quality assured with regional HELCOM Recommendations on waterborne pollution input assessment (37-38/1-Rev.1) and monitoring of airborne pollution input (37-38/2-Rev.1) as well as regional Guidelines. The airborne input is provided in cooperation with EMEP.","HELCOM's Pollution Load Compilations require a developed regional integrated water resources management regime and coherent transboundary policy and cooperation (SDG 6.5, 17.14), to be able to produce regional key assessments and indicators and cater for tracking the nutrient inputs to the Baltic Sea from the catchment area (and beyond for the airborne deposition) and the regional nutrient reduction scheme (14.1, 15.1).

            Completion of Project","Women, youth, farmers, communities, Industry","Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Nepal",Asia and Pacific,"India Water Foundation, established in New Delhi (India) as a non-profit NGO & think tank emphasizes on familiarizing people regarding the vitalrole water, energy and environment play in human lives, their impact on health, economic growth, livelihoods of the people andcalamities that wreak havoc due to non-judicious harnessing of these natural resources. Generation of this awareness is facilitated through seminars, outreach and personal contact programs etc. As water is an essential component of power generation and food production, therefore, IWF is engaged in ensuring environmental security, water security, energy security and food security which are essential for sustainable development. We are of the conviction that water-related problems cannot be tackled through technological and engineering solutions alone; there is need to include ‘Soft Approach’ of capacity building among the people which is facilitated through sensitizing, incentivizing and galvanizing the people in water and environment related issues. Also, communication gap between Government as policy-maker-cum-custodian of natural resources, especially water resources can be tackled by civil society, serving as a catalyst between government and communities. Actors-Sector synergy across multi-stakeholder platforms is imperative to systematically integrate water resources management into climate adaptation and mitigation strategies, which IWF firmly acknowledges in affirmation. The North Eastern part of India is rich in important minerals such as coal, limestone, large forest cover, soil biodiversity, rich flora & fauna and blessed with abundant water bodies. One of the greatest hallmarks of this region is its rich biological, social, and cultural diversity boasting a rich variety of genetic resources, species, and ecosystems of global importance. Socio-cultural dimensions indigenous mountain communities in the Himalayas, especially Eastern Himalayas have strong and diverse spiritual and cultural beliefs regarding biodiversity and its conservation. The indigenous tribe population constitute majority of the total population. Agriculture is the main occupation of the people of this region. Even though the region receives heavy rainfall during the monsoon season, water was wasted as surface runoff. Practice of rampant deforestation, traditional slash and burn cultivation etc. drastically affected hydrological parameters (geogenic factors) viz. rainfall interception, infiltration, soil moisture, water yield, soil loss, floods etc. Unsustainable agricultural practices and mining had affected soil and water quality, making it acidic resulting in environmental degradation which are wholly anthropogenic factors. Community based participation shall be adopted through JalMitras (water friends), having passion for conservation of natural resources, especially water and capacity-building for them shall be facilitated under the guidance and supervision of our experts. Creation of small water reservoirs (JalKunds) and multi-purpose reservoirs will fulfill needs of drinking & domestic water, irrigation, livestock, micro hydel, etc. especially in lean season yielded fruitful results for water-linked missions like farming, forestry, pisciculture, Sericulture. Etc. Development of extensive communication strategies through public awareness on reducing ground and surface water pollution will be leveraged by IWF to sustain improved water-use efficiency practices like reduced water withdrawals from sources, lowered wastewater discharges to decrease pollution in water bodies, optimized energy consumption to deliver environmental benefits.","We ardently support the realization of Interlinking ‘Think Water –Think Health’ and would like to recommend the inclusion of cross implementation of SDG 3 that calls for Good Health and Well Being and SDG 6 with focus on Water and Sanitation. This has the potential to harness inter-related development priorities in the task of rural development and priorities; bring coordination between multi-stakeholders and help improve the efficacy of even government’s programs as well. Bringing such endeavors under one platform shall help address critical problems and issues. Since water is not a mere a sector but a socio-economic connector and ecosystems are linked with water. It is a key component of sustainable development, we are hopeful the acceleration framework addresses in holistic terms various targets of SDG 6 like water and sanitation; water management, especially water availability & quality in reducing vulnerability; water-use efficiency and strengthening water-linked ecosystem services. We are affirmative that the SDG framework shall enhance the scope towards Cooperation, Collaboration and Convergence through multi-stakeholders such as Government, civil societies, private entities and international agencies. . A ‘Transversal’ shift interlinking vertical linkages between water, energy and environment with horizontal linkages like Health, Agriculture, Entrepreneurship, etc must be incorporated and now it is a good opportunity to translate in action at grass root level. Adaptation is a global challenge that requires local solutions. Community resilience is strengthened through healthy ecosystem services and therefore, effective water-driven adaptation interventions should reflect the importance of ‘holistic & integrated water management’, especially water availability & quality. In such a scenario, knowledge-driven approach is required across sectors and actors at local level where indigenous knowledge, Nature based solutions, modern Science based solutions can be leveraged to enhance prosperity. Consideration of water aspects must encompass carrying generic principle of water planning at macro-level but customized with location specific purpose. High prioritization is required towards community pooling under the public trust doctrine towards water and food security, livelihoods, sustainable development etc. Sustainable interventions to reduce Urban-Rural disparity can only be achieved through education, empowerment and ownership by the rural community. Progressive learning through qualitative behavioral change, Knowledge exchange among stakeholders and disseminating scientific literacy holds the key to bring qualitative life among the rural community. To ensure it is achieved, communities need to be trained at the level of grass root institutions and organizations through decentralized approach. It must be ensured to make communities understand that rural economic development is not creating progress but building own capacity in order to collectively improve the socio-economic conditions. The real meaning of Bottom up Approach is the ‘Localization’ of water-related interventions where people’s participation especially women, children, youth and marginalized sections are foremost included.","The partners are like minded civil societies, Academia, District administration, women, youth etc. The beneficiaries will be the communities","Goal 2, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 15, Goal 17","2.3, 2.4 , 5.5, 6.1 , 6.2, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 7.3, 12.2, 12.8, 13.2, 13.3, 15.1, 15.3, 17.6, 17.14, 17.17","Mon, 05/01/2023 - 12:00","Thu, 05/01/2025 - 12:00","The imperatives of implementing SDGS and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change warrant a holistic approach in addressing vagaries emanating from water and climate change concurrently with the help of IWRM, water-energy-food nexus and ecosystem-based adaptation approaches to climate change. In the wake of growing global recognition that water is at the core of climate change, water is climate change and addressing climate change related issues warrant equal focus on addressing water related issues. In the wake of existing approaches to water and climate change, there is growing emphasis on ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) to climate change, which also addresses water related problems along with climate change. Thus, along with emphasis on IWRM and nexus approach, equal emphasis and significance is also being attached to ecosystem-based adaptation approach too. The role of ecosystems in helping the people adapt to climate change is gaining increasing wide recognition. Undoubtedly, the concept of EbA along with the notions of working with nature, building with the nature and green infrastructure has different scopes; nonetheless, they follow the same rationale. Healthy ecosystems and the multiple services provided by them constitute the raison d'être of human security and are a sine qua non in any strategy to safeguard against the vagaries of climate change. Apart from envisaging a cautiously worked out network of biodiversity-rich areas, healthy ecosystems also constitute bedrock of green infrastructure that can augment resilience to natural disasters like floods, landslides or storms. The challenges presented by the vagaries of climate change have enhanced the indispensability of sustainable ecosystems. Water is a cross-cutting issue both within and beyond the scope of Agenda 2030. This calls for according priority to the fundamental role of interactions at inter-sectoral level in the implementation of Agenda 2030 at national level and to ensure that measures under the Paris Agreement and Agenda 2030 are implemented in a coherent and complementary manner by each country. There is need for vigorous incorporation of interactions and joint implementation of the Paris Agreement and Agenda 2030, which could initially disrupt sectoral thinking and subsequently make a decisive contribution in terms of driving sustainable development owing to the complementary nature of the measures. Facilitating implementation of this approach warrants smarter decision-making based on the best knowledge available, and commitment to action with other sectors through working partnerships and shared responsibilities. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_sImgmV6Fs",0.875,0.5555555555555556,0.6666666666666666,0.75,1.0,0.2197802197802206

Due to its transboundary and multisectoral nature, the sustainable management of water resources requires the creation of transboundary and multisectoral cooperation frameworks. Such policy, legal and institutional cooperation frameworks can help reduce conflicts and contribute to peace. Access to financial resources can be a strong incentive for such cooperation frameworks. But the current financial ecosystem rarely enables transboundary and multisectoral investments. The way financing currently approaches water and related investments is overly national and sectoral. Major providers of water-related services like basin organizations and local governments lack access to capital. Meanwhile, it is not only sovereign states but also local governments and basin organizations (e.g. River Basin Organizations) who are the main provider of water-related services and therefore accountable for their integrated and sustainable management. But these entities are usually limited in their ability, including their access to financing, to successfully fulfill their mandate. Promoting access to public and private capital for these non-sovereign entities while strengthening their institutional capacities is crucial. UNCDF commits to contribute to these objectives, through a dedicated Financing for Water Program – the Blue Peace Financing Program, by:
- Unlocking public and private capital for better access to water-related services and transboundary water cooperation.
- Promoting access to public and private capital for water local and regional non-sovereign entities (e.g. River Basin Organizations), who manage water resources (surface and Groundwater).
- Providing Technical Assistance to strengthen the institutional capacity of these local and regional non-sovereign entities for them to mobilize and manage private and public capital.
- Providing technical support to these non-sovereign entities to develop pipeline of investment projects.
- Developing and implementing innovative blended finance mechanisms and financing instruments for water, peace and transboundary water cooperation.
- Transforming water cooperation frameworks into investment platforms through such innovative financing instruments and mechanisms. - Creating enabling environments by transforming policy, legal and institutional frameworks.
- Developing measurement instruments and impact frameworks for financing water and transboundary water cooperation.
- Strengthening partnerships across sectors, including with the commercial financial sector (investment banks, stock exchanges, insurance companies, etc.).
- Providing a new impact investment opportunity for institutional investors.","This Program uses water as entry point to create and strengthen transboundary and multisectoral cooperation frameworks and transform them into investment platforms through innovative financing mechanisms and instruments. Given the fact, that was is a cross-cutting issue and relevant for all SDGs, this Program will accelerate the implementation of all SDGs (direct or indirect). More concretely, this program will create impact as follows: - The current financial ecosystem will be transformed and better reflect the realities of our global challenges, including the global water crisis and climate change, which do not know national or sectoral boundaries. - A new market in the sustainable finance field will be created, providing innovative investment opportunities for (impact) investors. - The perception of the finance sector towards water and water-related projects will be transformed away from looking at water as a distinct sector towards recognizing water as a cross-cutting, transboundary (regional) and multisectoral impact investment opportunity. - Local and regional non-sovereign entities managing water resources will have (better) access to public and private capital to fund and finance water-related projects. - Local and regional non-sovereign entities managing water resources will have stronger institutional capacities and better legal and policy frameworks (a) to mobilize and manage funding and financing for water-related projects (b) for sustainable and integrated water resources management (IWRM) and (c) to build/develop and implement pipelines of investment projects. - Countries who share water resources will have a strong financial incentive to create transboundary and multisectoral water cooperation frameworks and to manage their shared resources collectively and in a sustainable and integrated way. - The water related investments promoted by the Blue Peace Financing Initiative will have a strong impact in the transboundary watersheds in crucial need of development initiatives. Hence, this initiative also offers investors to switch their investments from projects with a high carbon footprint to a blend of “green investment projects”. The biggest efforts that can be made to mitigate climate change are within the river basins targeted by the Blue Peace Financing Initiative. This reinforces the “Peace and cooperation” aspect of the initiative with an opportunity. - Local Communities have better and more affordable access to water-related services, such as drinking water, WASH, agriculture, energy, etc. - Inspiring new thinking on solutions in financing for transboundary water cooperation and peace and catalyzing new ideas and initiatives.","Gambia River Basin Development Organization (OMVG)

            Launch event","Policy makers, researchers, NGOs, practitioners and local communities dealing with the issue of salinization.","Bangladesh, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kenya, Morocco, Netherlands, Senegal, Vietnam",Global,"Salinization is rapidly becoming one of the biggest challenges for food production worldwide. Salt-affected soils occur naturally, for example in (semi)arid areas with limited precipitation. Also, along coastal regions and in deltas, salinity intrusion via tidal dynamics and sea level rise increasingly impacts agricultural production. Salinity severely impacts crop development and growth, threatening food security, biodiversity and livelihoods of millions of people in various parts of the world (SDG2, SDG6). It is therefore important to raise awareness about this issue, and develop measures appropriate to geographic conditions and local contexts.
Collaborating partners share the ambition to collectively develop and implement a ‘Global Campaign on Salinization’. The ultimate objective of this Campaign is to increase awareness about the issue of salinization among policy makers, researchers and practitioners in the global water and food sectors, and subsequently formulate and drive a joint agenda to strengthen policy, knowledge, and implementation.
This Commitment “Develop and implement a Global Campaign on Salinization” builds on several underlying principles:
•	The Campaign is first and foremost a communication activity that increases awareness by means of developing and using collective communication products, joint activities, organizing events. The aim is that in the medium term this Campaign will initiate the formulation of e.g. new research programmes and innovative implementation projects, or the promotion of new policies in this area.
•	The Campaign will not prescribe one specific response strategy to the salinization challenges. Response strategies may vary between mitigation and adaptation options, depending on local conditions and realities. Changes in water management systems, water infrastructure, but also modifications to agricultural production methods and growing salt tolerant crops varieties could be part of locally or regionally diversified response strategies to salinity.
•	The Campaign will stress, however, the need for integrated approaches in response to salinity challenges, including cooperation between the working areas of soil, water and crops. Salinization may be harmful when it comes to food production, or when groundwater is extracted in coastal regions. At the same time, salinization can be beneficial to coastal ecosystems, or provides the opportunity for shifts to aquaculture.
•	The Campaign will boost new ideas, bundle initiatives, and create a stronger (communication) momentum for the benefit of collaborating partners. The Campaign will not ‘claim’ already on-going initiatives, search for added value to all partners and complementarity to on-going work and mandates.
Before developing and implementing the campaign, further scoping will take place. In this phase (April-May 2023), discussions will be held with committed and potential partners to confirm collective ambitions, opportunities and conditions for working together on this Campaign. Issues to touch upon are overall coordination and task division, timeline, in-kind or in-cash contribution needs, etc.
During the development phase (May-September 2023), necessary preparatory work for the Campaign takes place: development of an overall communication plan, key message, communication material, activity planning, etc. (example: www.worldwaterday.org).
After that, an implementation phase (October 2023 and onwards) starts during which each partner implements agreed joint activities, and prepares communication about on-going initiatives.","The Campaign serves a greater purpose. Besides increasing awareness about the issue of salinization among policy makers, researchers and practitioners in the global water and food sectors, the ambition is to promote the formulation of a collective follow-up agenda: strengthen current and initiate new policies, knowledge and research programmes, and innovative implementation projects. Impact areas are:
1.	At policy level increased awareness about the water-food nexus and the need for an integrated approach to salinization taking into account climate change, soil, land and water management and sustainable food systems. Nexus thinking and a mindset for integrated measures are important preconditions to formulate new policies in response to salinization. Impact: Attention in policy networks, e.g. visible in UN level guidelines and national policies.
2.	Salinization is a complex issue with many dimensions and specific research fields. Think of the impact of mitigation and adaptation measures in the long term, but also ecophysiology, research on soil quality, groundwater flows and climate change impacts. Further development of knowledge base, networking and information sharing to improve mutual learning and increase the impact of public financing. Increasing access to and sharing existing knowledge is also necessary, by e.g. building links among the international and national knowledge hubs and networks. Impact: A joint research agenda, new research programs/consortia and funding, international/regional knowledge hubs, training activities.
3.	At the level of practitioners, including water managers and farmers, there is a growing demand to implement new innovation projects and learn from best practices and knowledge exchange on salinization, acknowledging differences between local conditions and response options. Impact: access to resources, new funding programmes targeting salinization events. webinars, training, business and farmer meetings to give practitioners access to best practices and solutions based on a systems/integrated approach.
In terms of immediate impacts and outputs of the commitment, we will work towards developing and using collective communication campaign material, targeted and coherent communication activities, developing and disclosing online databases with best practices, and a Launch event with broad international coverage and participation. Again, the Campaign will try to add value to on-going initiatives, and organize new activities that support the collective ambition of increased awareness about the issue of salinization.","FAO, INSAS, WASAG, Free University Amsterdam, Wageningen UR, ICBA, Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, ADB, ICCAD, CGIAR, GWP, The Salt Doctors, SeedNL, Deltares, Royal Eijkelkamp.","Goal 2, Goal 6, Goal 15, Goal 17",,"Mon, 05/01/2023 - 12:00","Thu, 10/31/2024 - 12:00","https://www.netherlandswaterpartnership.com/expertise/water-agrifood/sa…

The global conversation and mobilization around water have never been more crucial. Ensuring sustainable water management and access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) to all is crucial to fulfil the UN’s 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and secure an inclusive, climate-resilient future. As climate change continues to ravage the planet through floods, droughts and more intense storms – disproportionately hurting communities with the least power to change its course – protecting water can allow us to steer sustainable development on a wider scale by leveraging its impact on every area of our lives. To make the most of this chance, we propose three water actions to further support the water-related goals of the 2030 Agenda.
1.	Foster collaboration beyond the watershed
While water management tends to occur at the local, watershed or regional level – for instance, decisions about water use and allocation – many water-related challenges transcend national and regional boundaries and require a global response. The borderless nature of water is embodied in everyday economic activities, such as trade of agricultural commodities and the water used to produce them. Many of the world’s major rivers and aquifers cross multiple borders, making cooperation between countries essential for sustainable water management. Our first water action calls for sustainable and collaborative water management that reaches beyond the watershed, with participation from communities affected. To foster cooperation, the global community will need to consider the economies bound to the watershed on any side of a given border. 
2.	Maintain ecosystem health and implement the source-to-sea approach
The latest UN Water progress report emphasizes that one-fifth of the world’s river basins are experiencing rapid changes in the area covered by surface waters. Human activities, such as dam construction and agriculture, have intensified the change of freshwater ecosystems and hydrological patterns. Furthermore, while the ocean is the outlet of all human activities, it is often left out of water management discussions. Our second water action calls for early ecosystem consideration in water management and planning process as well as the implementation of the source-to-sea approach.
3.	Increase knowledge exchange and inclusive decision-making
The typical method of addressing water challenges is Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM). While IWRM has profoundly affected water planning practices in the last three decades, it has not yet yielded sustainable water outcomes. The results can inadvertently create conflict, exclude critical users or ignore gaps in water management. Our third water action calls for collaborative and inclusive engagement in water management to deliver more effective long-term outcomes. We need to enable policymakers to see not only watershed-wide water demand and supply, but also smaller-scale differences that illuminate inequalities, addressing issues of poverty, gender inequality, and inclusion of marginalized groups.","Water is not only critical for human and planetary survival in its own right, but cuts across the social, environmental and economic requirements of a healthy and thriving world. Achieving clean water and sanitation targets, as detailed in the 2030 Agenda’s Sustainable Development Goal 6,  can launch a ripple effect of benefits across the SDGs, such as poverty reduction (SDG 1), sustainable food production (SDG 2), improved health and well-being (SDG 3), gender equality (SDG 5), clean energy generation (SDG 7), provision of ecosystem services (SDG 15), and transboundary cooperation (SDG 17). Here we share progress to date for each of our proposed water actions:
1.	 Foster collaboration beyond the watershed
SEI’s work – such as the Water Beyond Boundaries initiative in Colombia’s Magdalena-Cauca River Basin and the Mekong River Basin in Southeast Asia, and Rwanda’s hydro-economic and climate change analysis –  transboundary water management can not only address water scarcity, but boost the health and livelihoods of those the basin supports.
2.	Maintain ecosystem health and implement the source-to-sea approach
SEI has put early ecosystem consideration into practical action with projects such as community-based ecosystem management for wetlands resilience in Thailand’s Songkhram River Basin. In California, SEI has been modelling complex water systems, including developing tools for aquatic habitat assessment that allow local authorities to protect threatened fish species. On the source-to-sea approach, SEI's Strategy for the Ocean and Biodiversity aims to improve the connections between land, coasts and the ocean through systemic approaches. The key levers of change for our seas and coasts revolve around the need for an integrated climate, biodiversity and development agenda. Nature-based solutions (NbS) are increasingly seen as an important piece of the puzzle for delivering multiple goals
3.	Increase knowledge exchange and inclusive decision-making
SEI’s initiative on Gender Equality, Social Equity and Poverty seeks to understand the interconnections between gender, equity, poverty and sustainability, with examples applied to water management in Bolivia, Colombia and Cambodia. By approaching water management with an intersectional lens, SEI has helped lay the groundwork for greater gender equality and social inclusion in WASH interventions, facilitated cooperative planning processes, such as serious games in Colombia and the Robust Decision Support framework.
SEI’s mission is to support decision-making and induce change toward sustainable development around the world by providing integrative knowledge that bridges science, policy and practice in the field of environment and development. We are committed to advancing with the Water Action Agenda and continuing the stakeholder dialogues across sectors, geographies, and scales beyond the UN 2023 Water Conference.","Our partners are committed to achieving SDG 6 and have joined SEI in previous and ongoing initiatives, such as Bolivia WATCH (WASH Thinking Connected to Hydrology, applied to three priority river basins in Bolivia—Upper La Paz, Pampa-Huari and Tupiza, supported by Bolivia’s Ministry of Environment and Water), Water Beyond Boundaries (with case studies in Colombia’s Magdalena-Cauca River basin and Thailand’s Lower Songkhram River, a tributary of the Mekong River in partnership with Colombia’s Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, the Mekong River Commission, and Asian Institute of Technology), Rwanda’s hydro-economic and climate change analysis (HECCA) supported by the World Bank, USAID Regional Water and Vulnerable Environment Activity in Central Asia, SEI's Strategy for the Ocean and Biodiversity, and ecosystem consideration in water planning and management in California.","Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 13, Goal 14, Goal 15, Goal 17","5.5, 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 7.a, 13.2, 13.3, 14.1, 15.1, 15.9, 17.7, 17.9, 17.14, 17.15, 17.16, 17.17",,,"1) Water Beyond Boundaries initiative:

The research program contributes to several SDGs, but in particular on SDG2 Zero Hunger and SDG6 Clean Water and Sanitation. Currently, challenges on the access to- and availability of food are related to gradual climate change, depleting freshwater resources, loss of biodiversity, land degradation, shocks and extreme events. All of the above, combined with changing demands from a fast growing and urbanising society are putting additional pressures on our already stressed and complex food systems. To find pathways to reach SDG2 and SDG6, we must increase our understanding of the trade-offs and synergies between the different elements of a food system in their local as well as their global contexts. In this research program these pathways are studied and further developed.","This research program has the following impacts. It supports to improve access to and production of safe and nutritious food while improving water resources management by taking into account other sectors. Therefore, this commitment has an impact on all SDGs and looks into different linkages (trade-offs and synergies) between the SDGs.  Moreover, it supports food systems to be more resilient to shocks and challenges that are faces nowadays but also in the future related to water. It also studies the use of multiple 'qualities' of water and therefore having an impact on water resource management.","local research institutes; ministries; embassies; civil organisations, non-governmental organisations; network organisations; international organisations; Wageningen Student Challenges; Wageningen Acedamy;  Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, Nature and Food Safety","Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 6, Goal 10, Goal 11, Goal 12, Goal 13","1.4, 1.5, 1.a, 2.1 , 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 , 2.5, 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, 3.2, 3.4, 3.d, 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 10.2, 10.5 , 11.1 , 11.3, 11.5, 11.a, 12.2, 12.3, 12.8, 12.a, 13.1, 13.b","Sun, 01/01/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2024 - 12:00",,1.0,0.0,0.0,0.75,1.0,0.4395604395604412

The concerns and wider aspirations of IAH leading to 2030 are enshrined in the São Paulo-Brussels Groundwater (BraBel) Declaration:
•	Groundwater is critical to Earth’s survival: Aquifers, our planet’s natural water reservoirs, hold 97% of the fresh and liquid water
•	Everyone must face these issues: Sustainable groundwater management needs monitoring, regulation, and communication.
•	It is imperative to protect groundwater through the following urgent actions: Strengthen the institutions responsible for the governance of groundwater so that they promote efficient, inclusive, ethical, democratic, and socio-ecologically conscientious policies.
•	Let’s make the invisible visible: There must be an effort by governments, hydrogeologists, NGOs, and all of society to make perceptible this crucial resource for planetary well-being and dignified human life.","Our new strategic plan provides particular support to the SDG6 capacity development accelerator, which seeks to ensure “A better-skilled workforce [that] improves service levels and increases job creation and retention in the water sector”. Through various initiatives we aim to enhance capabilities of those working in field of groundwater management throughout the world. We hope that there will be particular benefits for those working in lower income countries, where we will also link with partner organisations such as RWDN, SADC, etc.","The International Association of Hydrogeologists (IAH/AIH) works with many partners across the world in the field of groundwater science, education, development and protection.

With the Mediterranean basin being globally the most vulnerable area to upcoming climate change in terms of droughts and temperature rise, the outlook is far from positive. In combination with the rapid increasing population of Egypt (1mio people every 9 months), the pressure on the ecosystems will continue to increase if no actions are taken, with negative socio-economic impact to those communities depending on these ecosystems. Our approach employs 'Nature-based Solutions', which will improve biodiversity and the ecosystem’s resilience, by mimicking nature. The planned interventions flush the lagoon, improve the water quality, and, in combination with wetlands restoration and sustainable fishery, this will lead to more biodiversity and more fish catch and thus jobs for the communities. We make fertile soils from the lagoon sediments for regreening and regenerative agriculture. These works are predicted to lead to more rain, which would ensure the project’s long-term sustainability. Our methodology includes the co-creation of a masterplan with the local communities: they will determine the land development. The local communities, mainly Bedouin tribes, are (amongst other organisations) organised in fishing cooperations and farming cooperations. They have and should maintain the leading role in the management and development of the lake and the land. Our governance structure is securing that by having in its heart a non-profit association where members from all stakeholder groups and levels will guide, lead and guard the intentions of the initiative. Our partner ‘ORG Permanent Modernity’ are experts in that field. Within this initiative, national and international bodies are possible to take up the role for the development of projects/investments within the collaborative masterplan. Thus on the basis of the co-created masterplan an investment catalogue is produced. In this catalogue different projects are defined that together form the masterplan. These projects could be carried out by different organisations, leading to economic opportunities for (new) local businesses.","Large scale and strategic regreening to increase precipitation (rain) and restore the water cycle is a novelty. The initiative could possibly be the first large-scale intervention that embodies the concept of Earth stewardship – “the proactive shaping of physical, biological, and social conditions to sustain, rather than disrupt, critical earth-system processes in support of nature and human wellbeing at local-to-planetary scales”. By focussing on finding the right cross-scale alignment and positive synergies between important leverage points – e.g. vision, social norms and human agency – it could open up novel pathways towards restoring the relationship between society and nature as part of the biosphere. With reference to the SDG’s, the BSI addresses them as follows (in brief): End Hunger: Main objective of the BSI is to improve the socio-economic benefits of the local communities (boost local economic activities such as fisheries and agriculture, provide jobs, education, etc.). Increasing economic standards in combination with more locally produced food and improved water quality will increase health and wellbeing. Responsible consumption and production: Regenerative fisheries and regenerative agriculture is at the core of the solution. The living biomass will be embedded in the financing systems, e.g. farmers and fishermen will be rewarded by improving the ecological functionality of the area. This means that the contribution to a strong an biodiverse food web, or the contribution to the water cycle, or the carbon content of the soil will release additional funding to these people. Climate action: The initiative has the objective to restored the water cycle, cool the area, reduce extreme weather, sequestration of greenhouse gases and regenerated aquatic ecosystem and associated wetlands (bird habitats) and terrestrial ecosystem on a very large scale.

            Final deliverable of the initiative with an established Cooperation Agreement","Private sector companies in South America, especially small and medium-sized enterprises in the region.","Argentina, Macquarie University, Colombia, Ecuador, Uruguay",Latin America and the Caribbean,"The objective is to promote the involvement of the private sector in the challenges of efficient water management in its production processes.  For this, the promotion of a Cooperation Agreement between South American Chambers of Commerce and Industry is carried out with the purpose of impacting, above all, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the region, which means more than 99% of the companies in South America.
The Agreement between Chambers of Commerce and Industry proposes the promotion of reciprocal cooperation between institutions in South America (Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Uruguay), in which the promotion of projects, programs and/or activities of diffusion, training, consultancy and any other type of collaboration and exchange in the area of efficient water management in the business field is proposed.
During the last year, with a call at the regional level, training, awareness, and dissemination activities (Webinars) on the efficient use of water in the productive sector were carried out. Within these activities, basic knowledge on the implementation of the ISO 14046:2014 methodology for measuring the Water Footprint has been transmitted, as well as experiences of some companies in this matter have been shared. This has made it possible to disseminate the advantages and potential of efficient water management at a corporate level.
Business actions for the efficient use of water are related to the measurement of the Water Footprint both in product development and in the use of water at the organizational level, as well as circular economy activities, water reuse, cleaner production, among other.
In this way, it is expected to contribute to adaptation, resilience and reduction of climate risk in industry and agribusiness, developing capacities in the Business Chambers so that a greater number of companies in the region integrate strategies for the efficient use of water in their production processes.","Based on the social capital that has been cultivated amongsome South American Chambers of Commerce and Industry, a greater involvement of the private sector is expected in water efficiency actions and to accelerate the dissemination and awareness of society about the impacts related to climate change.
The regional approach of the private sector, especially SMEs, means a complementary effort to those that have been carried out in the public, academic or civil society spheres in water care. Likewise, it is understood that efficient water management has the double condition of generating competitive advantages for companies in the market and the potential of communicating good practices in water care to consumers.
The alliance also proposes the exchange of knowledge and experiences in order to generate joint learning that allows accelerating the implementation of the SDGs from the private sector.","Chambers of Commerce and Industry from Argentina, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Uruguay, among others to incorporate.","Goal 6, Goal 9, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 15, Goal 17","6.4, 6.a, 9.4, 12.2, 12.6, 13.1, 13.3, 15.5, 17.6, 17.9","Sat, 04/01/2023 - 12:00","Wed, 05/15/2024 - 12:00","https://www.gwp.org/es/GWP-Sud-America/EN-ACCION/GWP-en-las-noticias/20…

            Global impact: to influence and help bring about transformational change in how services are provided for over 2 billion people who still lack safe water and sanitation across the globe.","The main beneficiaries are first and foremost the 20 million we want to serve locally with improved services and the 200 million people we want to reach nationally through systems strengthening. IRC, Water For People and Water For Good remain steadfastly committed to advancing a systems change approach to solving the global water and sanitation crisis. Water For People,  IRC will continue to be actively involved in Agenda for Change, Millennium Water Alliance, Sanitation and Water for All, and other alliances and collaborations, and will continue to participate in other opportunities to further our mission.","Bangladesh, Macquarie University, Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Ethiopia, Ghana, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Malawi, Mali, Nicaragua, Niger, Peru, Rwanda, Uganda","Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, West Asia, Global","Our objective is to help achieve SDG 6: Clean Water and Sanitation for All around the world. There are just 7 years left, but the latest Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) figures indicate the world is disappointingly off-target. Destination 2030, or D30, is Water For People, Water For Good, IRC’s joint vision to accelerate progress in reaching this milestone. We believe that billions of lives can and must be transformed with sustainable access to water and sanitation. SDG 6 demands that every country has systems that raise the standard of service delivery, while also relentlessly seeking solutions for the unserved. 
Destination 2030 identifies three impact pathways to achieve SDG 6 (collectively known as ""D30 Goals""):
1.	Local – increasing local water, sanitation, and hygiene systems to improve services for more than 20 million people in districts;
2.	National – strengthening national water, sanitation, and hygiene systems to improve services for more than 200 million people; and
3.	Global – challenging the status quo, to influence leaders and support people and organizations to find ways to deeply influence and contribute to transformational change in how WASH services are provided to two billion people globally.
Destination 2030 has identified six desired outcomes to achieve both the Human Right to Water and Sanitation and our Impact Targets:
1. High level political will for universal and sustainable access to water and sanitation
services drives accelerated progress toward SDG 6.
2. Key actors have the capacity to improve planning, service provision, and regulation.
3. Secure finance for the sector achieves SDG 6 and increases the value of public and
private investments in resilient water, sanitation, and hygiene.
4. Citizens demand higher levels of service, more can pay their rates, and there are
subsidies for those who cannot pay.
5. Collective action drives transformative change through stronger and more effective
partnerships within and beyond the water, sanitation, and hygiene sector.
6. Organizational change supports Destination 2030.
Our approaches using research, innovation, data, technical know-how, advocacy, influence, and co-investment of rate payers and government all help strengthen the
WASH systems in which we work and seek to improve. The intermediate outcomes lead to greater impact through people reached with improved services at the local,
national, and global levels – our 2030 long term outcomes. This is all done with an unwavering focus on SDG 6 that is closing the gap for the 2+ billion people in the
world that still live without sustainable water and sanitation services.","Fundamentally, the world is changing; WASH must change, too. The WASH sector is still too siloed and fragmented, we believe that a radically different approach is needed; our Destination 2030 alliance is our commitment to challenge ourselves to model a new, collaborative, joined-up way of working. We believe that a collective action approach that changes business as usually will finally solve this challenge by connecting big, disruptive ideas with real, operational delivery. We envision
Destination 2030 to be rooted in:
1.	Synergistic Strengths – Water For People is a globally recognized leader in helping deliver universal and sustainable services, and a facilitator of sanitation market systems development at the local and national levels. IRC is a globally recognized WASH systems champion at the international level and strengthened at the national level.  Water for Good is tackling water poverty in one of the world’s most forgotten countries – the Central Africa Republic. The organisation have long inspired the global WASH sector to think big even in fragile states, with a commitment to working with local, permanent institutions to create sustainable services at scale. We aspire to do more at the global level. In fact, these aspirations form the impact pathways of our Destination 2030 vision. In addition, our combined footprint in 16 focus countries means we can have greater impact working together in these countries – and eventually expand to more countries.
2.	Collective Action – We have a better chance of achieving our Destination 2030 vision if we work with partners versus working alone. In fact, we will eventually welcome other partners to join us. Ideal alliance partners will be those who excel in helping develop sustainable WASH services in countries where we do not already work, and who also desire to be part of a global alliance.
3.	Changing Ourselves – We are in the process of adapting our business models towards more decentralized management and governance structures aligned with the key principle of subsidiarity – what can be done locally should be. We believe our leadership, decision-making processes, and organizational structures need to better reflect and represent the people and places where we work, while delivering our work with local, national, and global legitimacy.","Water For Good, Water For People, IRC","Goal 3, Goal 4, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 8, Goal 9, Goal 11, Goal 13, Goal 16, Goal 17","6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.5, 6.a, 6.b","Wed, 01/01/2020 - 12:00","Tue, 01/01/2030 - 12:00","Please find additional information below:

            Adaptive infrastructure and water resources able to adequately respond to climate change effects or events",People living in the supply areas of the water and sanitation providers mentioned under partners.,"Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana, Indonesia, Kenya, Lao People's Democratic Republic, Malawi, Mali, Netherlands, Philippines, State of Palestine, Global Action Plan, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe","Africa, Asia and Pacific","The effects of climate change are putting access to water and sanitation services at risk. Urban water utilities are at the forefront of ensuring access to water and sanitation for all, but the sustainability of the services is vulnerable, as ground and surface water resources are threatened by pollution, increasing salinisation, sedimentation and droughts. Every year, the effects of climate change are becoming more profound, not only due to water stress but also heavy rainfall and flooding put the infrastructure of water utilities at risk.
On the road towards becoming a resilient utility, capable to adjust and respond to these new conditions, there is a long way to go. More often than not, the utility doesn’t have a seat at the table when it comes to water resource management, while drinking water production for billions of people heavily depends on these water resources. Another limiting factor is that data and models on the effects of climate change are not easily accessible or used in the multi annual plans of utilities. Since the impacts of climate change threaten water supply and sanitation services of many – vulnerable – people, the 50 utilities associated in WaterWorX developed a proposal with a focus on adaptation to climate change impacts.
WaterWorX is a long-term partnership between the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Netherlands, all 10 Dutch water utilities and 40 utilities in Africa and Asia. The programme started in 2017 and has proven - via the water utilities – to successfully improve and sustain drinking water and sanitation services and expand these services to new people that relied on unreliable and or unsafe sources, mainly living in low income areas. Between 2017 and 2021 the WaterWorX programme contributed to first time access to piped water and sanitation services for 1.6 million people. WaterWorX also improved the services of current customers of partner utilities, towards safely managed services, by increasing hours of supply, improving water quality and providing people with a connection on their premise. 
In 2022, the second phase of the programme started. In this phase WaterWorX focusses on accelerating performance improvement of utilities, mobilize investments and to provide an additional 3.5 million people with water & sanitation services towards the 10 million people target of WaterWorX. However, climate change is now globally acknowledged as one of the main risks for achieving the SDG6 agenda. 
This new programme therefore aims to support its partners in adapting to the effects of climate change, and provide access to climate proof water services to people being vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The programme aims at improved exploitation, protection and extension of water resources to supply new and existing water users with safe and reliable water, knowing that all water resources experience heavy climate induced stress. The interventions will support utilities and vulnerable people to become more adapted to the effects of climate change.","The expected impact of this programme is: Enhanced resilience of people and organizations to climate change impacts.
The programme contributes to SDG6 by connecting new people, vulnerable to the effects of climate change, to the water supply network. It also contributes to SDG 15, by contributing to the conservation of biodiversity. The programme aims to improve and protect the quality of water resources, which contributes to live in, under and around water. Water source protection can improve water quality, restore reliable water flows and bring added benefits to local ecosystems and communities.
SDG6 plays a central role in achieving other SDGs. Access to water & sanitation prevents diseases (SDG3) and saves time to get water elsewhere. Time that could also have been invested in economic activity and thus reduce poverty (SDG1). School participation is increasing (SDG4) because children are less sick (diarrhoea) and girls in the menstrual period can continue participating in school because of better water & sanitation facilities at school. Women benefit from water facilities because they often spend hours organizing water (SDG 5, gender). Finally, people stop boiling water when they have access to safe water, thus reducing deforestation (SDG13 – climate action).","Dunea

Aqua for All, a long-term partner of the Government of the Netherlands, plays an important role in catalysing private capital. Financial Inclusion will allow sustainable water enterprises playing a vital role in complementing government efforts, to have access to investments and working capital. Access to capital allows access to technology, current business practices, spurring growth and professionalisation of the sector. However, there is a limited track record and impact investors need to understand the risk-return profiles, the opportunities, and the impact gained to increase their allocations.
Aqua for All commits to facilitating and enabling urgently needed private investment into the sector. Together with a range of stakeholders, we develop and contribute to de-risking instruments and provide catalytic capital towards the acceleration of SDG 6.","Progress towards SDG 6 requires sustainable and long-lasting interventions and public and private contributions to an enabling environment. By catalysing private capital for the WASH sector, we enable market-based acceleration of safe drinking water and sanitation services and facilities. 
This initiative aims to contribute to other Sustainable Development Goals wherever possible. This includes building a portfolio of WASH initiatives that economically empowers people by building capacity and by stimulating jobs in the sector (SDG1); stimulate women’s empowerment with a gender-based approach (SDG5); ensure low carbon and climate resilient WASH infrastructures (SDG13); include diverse private and public partners working jointly towards the SDG goals (SDG17); and ultimately contribute towards improved health diminishing the risk of water-borne diseases (SDG3).","La Banque Agricole, Senegal (LBA)

In this framework the communal infrastructure needs to address integrated water resource management (IWRM) at all levels by 2030, including the equitable and efficient use of water resources, which is essential for social and economic development, as well as environmental sustainability. In this aspect, waste should not be wasted, and wastewater treatment plants should shift to “closing material and energy streams” by implementing nature-based solutions (NBS) to reuse water, biomass, and energy and transforming them from waste to valuable green products.
The main challenge of changing paradigm towards IWRM is unawareness which needs to be overcome by education activities, demonstration projects, platforms with suitable information etc. In the field of NBS, water reuse and circular economy the gaps towards wider implementation are even bigger. There is a need to develop clear legislation that would consider environmental, economic and social factors of IWRM which would also need to be supported by financial incentives.
Methodologies to gain higher awareness and to overcome knowledge gaps:
-	Awareness rising: workshops for different stakeholders
-	Education: convincing with facts, showcases, capacity building of local practitioners and policy makers, inclusion of youth,
-	Expert involvement
-	Demonstration: sharing experiences from end users, pilot projects
The methodologies will be implemented through GWP Toolbox and Community of Practice on nature-based solutions (NBS) in water management, community hubs, the GWP CEE Summer School as well other educational activities and stakeholder engagement fora.","NBS have been identified as a key adaptation measure of Climate Action (Green Deal) to address the above challenges. In the agricultural landscape, NBS can be applied for soil health, carbon mitigation, downstream water quality protection, biodiversity benefits as well as assisting agricultural production and supply chains to achieve net-zero environmental emissions while achieving food and water security and meeting climate goals.

The celebration",Local and regional governments,Spain,"Africa, Europe, Asia and Pacific, North America, Latin America and the Caribbean, West Asia","On behalf of the Global Taskforce of Local and Regional Governments,  facilitated by the United Cities and Local governments, our initiative aims at bringing to light crucial role that local and regional governments play in water related issues, and the need to involve subnational institutions in decisions that go beyond water management. 
The adoption of a political statement from the constituency of local and regional governments aims at bringing to light the importance of a renewed water governance, through calls from more than 323,000 sub-national institutions, from small municipalities to metropolises and regions. One of our objective is to remind that local authorities form a vital bridge between national governments, communities and citizens and will have a critical role in a new global partnership. 
Our constituency be present throughout the UN Water Conference, in particular through a local and regional governments day, to advocate for the fulfilment of the right to water, acknowledged by the United Nations as ""a fundamental right essential for the full enjoyment of the right to life and all human rights"". Still the right to water is not formally applied, particularly at local level. The scarcity and deterioration of water quality exacerbate inequalities of access.   very poorest people are the first to suffer. In many local and regional governments of least developed countries, women are the ones taking care and suffering from water distribution. In many countries of the South, the most vulnerable populations are subject to water shortages.
Our initiative aims at reminding that local and regional governments have been engaged in protecting their communities in such complex times, focusing on securing water supply and sanitation, avoiding water scarcity, protecting aquatic ecosystems, and fostering care systems.
City diplomacy and decentralised cooperation are the tools of local and regional government to continue to deliver essential water services to those who need it most. To ensure we leave nobody and no place behind and achieve SDG6, as well as all other SDGs we call, through our mobilization, for a more interconnected multilateral system based on multi-level governance and multi-stakeholder collaboration. Our organized constituency reinstates our commitment to the transformation of the multilateral system driven by the power of collective action, under our strategic input towards the SDGs Summit and Summit for the Future.
In regards to global water governance, our initiative calls on the international multilateral system to consider the many aspects of an urban world: rural and urban territories, small and intermediate cities, metropolitan entities, and regions. It must also provide financial support and capacity building for local and regional governments (LRGs) to engage in this process. An approach across government and society for addressing inequality, climate change and biodiversity, and for fostering peace is equally critical to changing our systems. The renewed multilateral system will also need to consider water and conflicts where water is being used as a weapon, war crimes or crimes against humanity related to water resources.","The commitments underlined in this initiative are made to ensure an accelerated implementation of SDG 6, ensuring all targets are met, and for a renewed governance that closes the gap through the localization of this and all water-related SDGs.
Our constituency of local and regional governments calls for a stronger consideration of water as a human right, including access to safe and affordable drinking water and sanitation for all to encourage ongoing support from all spheres of government to ensure access to water and sanitation services for all so as to meet targets 6.1 and 6.2.
Regarding sustainable management, we call to strengthen the capacities of local and regional governments in building sustainable management models, protecting water as a public good, and developing an integrated and comprehensive approach to water management at all levels,  including water efficiency-related topics such as solid waste management, agriculture, and environmental health to reach target 6.4. It is also essential to acknowledge the crucial role of multi-level governance and multi-stakeholder collaboration when it comes to protecting our ecosystem, as well as the promotion of sustainable and responsible use of water
Our constituency calls on national governments and the international system to contribute to the development of an enabling environment for local and regional governments to implement, run and regulate water efficiently, and user-centered essential services, such as safe water production and supply, wastewater management, and solid waste management, and for their involvement in any decisions related to improving water management so as to reach target 6.3 by 2030.
This document will address the importance of strengthening local public service provision and the right to water, as well as the protection of water ecosystems, including mountains forests, wetlands  and biodiversity, thus addressing target 6.6 directly.
A renewed international and multilateral system is the way for more equitable governance of water, we call on the involvement of intermediary cities, small towns, and rural areas and territories in the achievement of SDG6 and the universal development agendas. This means ensuring women and girls’ inclusion in water management, and including them in positions of responsibility, and promoting participatory, inclusive approaches that ensure all voices are accounted for and represented in decision-making, enabling us to reach targets 6.5 and 6.B
To ensure that goal 6 is achieved, it is critical to renew the financial structure and different involvement of the private sector. We call on development banks and central banks to provide direct access to financing for ""Climate-Biodiversity"" projects of cities, and to allow bidding in all official languages of the United Nations.  We aim at encouraging innovative financial solidarity mechanisms at local level, and rethink fiscal architecture, strengthen local finance to provide sufficient financial capacity to reach the SDG targets. It will be critical to establishing instruments - at the national and multilateral levels - to finance water savings and expand international cooperation and capacity building to support those governments that are further away, allowing us to meet target 6.A","As facilitator of the Global Taskforce of Local and Regional Governments (GTF), a global coordination  mechanism that gathers the constituency of local and regional governments,  UCLG has involved the following organisations in a consultation in order to establish new commitments to renew water governance and achieve SDG6.

We are a dedicated UN fund that takes the best ideas from development financing and applies them to countries with the highest need, yet least ability to respond, to catalyze national sanitation economies. 
Working globally and with an initial footprint in Africa, SHF is mobilizing resources to develop and fund a pipeline of investable propositions to create sustainable sanitation economies and menstrual hygiene marketplaces, driving national targets and helping women gain greater economic hold. Our catalytic approach unlocks resources of multilateral and national development banks, finance institutions and governments, and enables the private sector to build lasting national sanitation, hygiene, and menstrual hygiene market ecosystems.
In line with the UN Common Agenda, we put women and girls - their choice, voice and power - at the center of these markets so that they benefit from better health, education, jobs and a cleaner environment. We aspire to see thriving marketplaces where the poorest and most disadvantaged women and girls are able to take control of their bodies and their social and economic status.","Progress towards the global target of achieving access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and ending open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, by 2030 is lagging behind. This means that more than 4 billion people globally are missing out on the education, gender, health, work and climate benefits that safe sanitation, hygiene and menstrual health bring, and 500 million menstruators are without the basics to manage their menstrual health and hygiene safely. 
Targets are missed because the available funding falls considerably short of the global need, and in many countries systems to support the sector are weak - lacking in regulation, reliable investment and capacity to deliver sustainable impact. Despite being basic economic, health, and social issues, they remain unaddressed. 
Similarly, funding for gender equality is not keeping pace with need, with only 4.6% of bilateral allocable ODA going to programmes where gender equality is the main objective. At the same time, it has been estimated that the potential global market for impact investing is as much as US$ 269 trillion (the financial assets held by institutions and households) and that the size of the impact investing market currently stands at US$ 1.2 trillion in assets under management. Channeling just a small proportion of this potential investment to social, environment and economic outcomes, would go a long way towards closing funding gaps.
Sanitation, with its potential for growth, is a sound, long-term investment that creates prosperity. For example, estimates of the sanitation and menstrual hygiene market potential are in Nigeria US$ 14.2 billion, in Kenya US$ 3.1 billion and for Uganda US$ 3.4 billion. In addition, in emerging markets small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) create 7 out of 10 formal economy jobs, and because sanitation and menstrual hygiene economies can be leaders in job creation, the scope for employment is significant.
In addition to progress towards SDG 6, investing in access to sanitation, hygiene and MHH drives impact across a broad range of development areas including SDG 3, 4, 5, 6, 8 and 13.","The Government of the Netherlands, Directorate-General for International Cooperation (DGIS)

The partners of the Blue Deal believe that water management at local or regional level is the key to really making a difference to the living environment of people, plants and animals. The ambition is that water authorities abroad are able to manage and maintain their water systems and associated infrastructure in a sustainable way, resulting in improved access to clean, sufficient and safe water for 20 million people. Dutch Water Authorities are partnered with mostly river basin, catchment- and waste water treatment organisations abroad. In the partnership they will work together on long-term solutions aimed at managing and maintaining water resources in the future. Climate adaptation and social inclusion are fixed elements of this long-term approach, as well as connecting regional and national water policy, and cooperation with other strategic partners. The Blue Deal strengthens the partners’ capacity to implement long-term solutions. This is done in the field of governance and integrated water management. Partners work together to promote: 1. adequate knowledge and expertise in the field of water management; 2. strong institutions; 3. collaboration with important stakeholders. Important themes are the establishment of a well-functioning management and maintenance of water management and financial independence of the local partner. The Blue Deal works on ‘soft’ capacity building and does not itself make any major ‘hard’ investments in operation and maintenance. The programme seeks to create leverage with other investment programmes. The Blue Deal can increase the impact of investments by others through the programme’s long-term nature, strengthening local government and the long-term approach at regional level.","The programme is divided into two stages: 2019-2022 and 2023-2030. The financial size of the programme is increased from an average of €5 million per year in phase 1 to an average of €10 million per year in phase 2. This results in: increased availability of capacity for the program including increased efforts on climate adaptation to strengthen resilience to climate-related hazards; enhanced knowledge exchange between partnerships and organizations; and, increased collaboration with investment programs. Theory of Change (ToC) is that when we strengthen the water governance in a region this subsequently clears the way for sustainable implementation of climateresilient Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM). This is achieved by peer-to-peer capacity strengthening from Dutch water authorities to water authorities in other countries, to make progress on two Blue Deal outcomes: improved water governance and, specifically, improved climate-resilient IWRM. We strengthen the implementation capacity of our partners through a three-tier approach to capacity: promoting adequate knowledge and expertise on water, strong institutions and good cooperation with key stakeholders.2 In this capacity-building approach, attention for climate change and climate adaptation is interwoven with activities. To sustain the improved IWRM, working on operation & maintenance forms an essential part of the Blue Deal partnerships.","Dutch Water Authorities, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Infrastructure of The Netherlands, Blue Deal partner organizations.","Goal 6, Goal 13, Goal 17","6.3, 6.5, 13.1, 17.6","Tue, 01/01/2019 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2030 - 12:00",https://dutchwaterauthorities.com/media/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ_Dm3cj7tY,0.25,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.8241758241758272

The objective of our initiative is to help governments achieve resource- and water-efficient and climate resilient economies and societies, conservation and sustainable management of natural resources and ecosystems, and sustainable supply and use of water resources to meet the needs of a growing world population within the sustainable limits of the planet's natural resources and ecosystems. By linking the physical and digital worlds, we aim to provide a tailored, intelligent solution for water, harness the value of data, and promote greater information transparency and accountability.
The International Research Centre on Artificial Intelligence under the Auspices of UNESCO (IRCAI) is in the process of establishing The Water Observatory, a science-based set of state-of-the-art technological tools for water management and ESG (environmental, social and governance) reporting and informed decision making. It is a SaaS platform that helps governments collect, process and analyze water and ESG data to automate reporting in accordance with key frameworks of the UN. It reports water footprints in real time across multiple data sources to better align with SDG 6, national and international policies and assess ""Reflect and Respond"" commitments.
The platform will use AI to analyze large amounts of data to help water resource managers solve problems related to water events and understand the impact of their actions in a broader context, particularly how they affect the public and private sectors and consumers. This will also help achieve the water-related goals of Agenda 2023. The Water Observatory will use machine learning to generate extract insights and best practices, and work with local, regional, and national governments to address industry, societal, and research challenges.","The impact of the proposed technology was tested in three geographic locations, Brăila, Carouge, and the municipality of Alicante, resulting in three levels of impact:
1.	Local impact:  The Municipality of Alicante is establishing its new Center for Water Excellence, using our holistic solution to accomplish its digital transformation into a smart city by modernizing and digitizing its water sector with technology capable of controlling and managing the city's water ecosystem.
2.	Regional impact: The Water Observatory can be used in the context of extreme weather events (such as the fires in Slovenia and extensive draughts in France in 2022) to gather, analyze, and explore insights and best practices from the global experience of researchers and practitioners in water issues such as floods, landslides, and contamination, building business intelligence from available open data combined with local sources.
3.	Global impact: As water-related climate events transcend national boundaries, observing the world on a global scale can help us better understand the role of water in the context of climate change, address SDG 13 on climate action, and engage all actors in the water ecosystem. Using ethical machine learning algorithms based on open data measurements and statistical indicators will help the water sector better understand changes and better prepare for action. It can empower all stakeholders: from policy makers to businesses to local, regional, national, and international authorities. The Water Observatory made available by IRCAI can enable national and regional authorities to make better-informed decisions and plan better-prepared strategies that take into account different perspectives on the impacts of climate change on water. The Water Observatory will only achieve its global impact as more data from more governments is added to the platform. It can be tailored to the needs of specific countries and integrated at a later stage into a larger family of observatories to monitor all 17 SDGs.
4.	Water management industry and policymakers: Water resource managers and policy makers can use the information gathered by The Water Observatory in solving problems related to water events to understand how their actions are perceived by consumers and to explore successful scenarios in similar cases.

Our mission is to provide a sustainable taste of high-quality fruits and vegetables to anyone, anywhere, at anytime – of which conserving, reusing and recycling water are indispensable components.
We recognize that the actions and innovations of the private sector have a significant impact on the ability to produce food in a water-efficient, sustainable, and circular way, and we have the desire to accelerate a positive change in our sector by contributing to the global efforts towards a food and water secure future for all. 
Through the recycling of different water streams inside the greenhouse we already greatly reduce the water demand compared to open field agriculture (between 95% and 60% less, depending on greenhouse type). We are aiming to reduce this amount even further, whilst minimizing our environmental impact and increasing our overall circularity. We have translated this ambition into a range of aligned goals and deliverables for the UN Water Action Agenda, listed below:
1.	Water Use Impact & Life Cycle Assessment (LCA)
We will assess our Life Cycle and Water Use Impact, which will aid in the understanding of our current water impact, for both operation and construction. The information that it will provide will be used to prioritize actions and identify opportunities to improve both water management practices and the efficiency of water use in the production process. The LCA will aid in the establishment of a target for the reduction of our water impact for the Water Action Agenda from 2024 onwards. New materials that require less water can be implemented, as well as water-saving technologies and water management practices for improved operation. 
2.	Promoting Awareness and Accelerating Cross-Sectoral Collaboration
Our aim is to increase awareness within our existing greenhouses on water-saving developments to improve current water management practice.  In addition to promoting awareness on the possibilities of collaborating with the greenhouse industry to accelerate cross-sectoral synergies and facilitate responsible production and consumption of food. What the interdisciplinary cross-overs would entail, and how this would benefit the sustainable development goals is further elaborated on in the paragraph that describes expected impact.
3.	Test Facility, Validated Water model and improved concept for high-tech greenhouses with optimized water use
Sensor data can provide the empirical evidence needed to validate and further improve the operational water  models linked to our greenhouses. For this reason, our existing project(s) will be equipped with elaborate sensors to monitor water quantity and quality over a multitude of years, allowing for a comprehensive picture of our water system, ultimately aiding in the continuous improvement of our high-tech greenhouses concepts.
Evaluating the progress of our commitments regularly will help us to identify any areas where additional resources or expertise are needed, or where changes to the plan may be necessary to achieve the goals of the commitment.","The agricultural sector is one of the largest water-consuming industries, accounting for the majority of global freshwater usage. With water being such a critical component of food production, reducing the amount that is needed to grow a kilogram of produce can significantly impact both local and global water consumption. Improvements on integrated and water-efficient food production will benefit many regions, but most directly those that are already facing water scarcity, or will do so in the future. 
To move towards circular food systems, and have the biggest impact, we believe that water, sustainability and circularity are ideally approached from multiple scale levels. On the one hand, on a smaller scale, we need to look at the projects themselves - implementing solutions on project level that reduce the water and nutrient demand to an absolute minimum. For example by conserving, reusing and recycling water streams and nutrients, making smart water management choices and/or implementing and developing water-saving technologies and innovations. For our sector, soilless cultivation in greenhouses, the aim can even go as far as saying that the only water that leaves the greenhouse, would be the water inside the produce itself. 
On the other hand, we also need to look at large-scale circularity and cross-disciplinary collaboration. A specific example from the high-tech greenhouse industry would be the synergies that can take place when a wastewater treatment facilities and high-tech greenhouses collaborate. 
High-tech greenhouses need four input streams to produce food: (1) water, (2) nutrients, (3) energy and (4) CO2, which can all be obtained from wastewater. We can treat the wastewater and use it for cooling and irrigation for the greenhouses, we can use the nutrients from wastewater, we can use the wasteheat from wastewater and we can also use CO2 that would otherwise be emitted into the environment, and inject it into the greenhouses to improve our crop production.  
This way we don’t look at food production as a singular box where resources go in, and food goes out. Instead, we integrate the greenhouses into a larger overarching concept, pushing the functionality beyond that of supplying food security. Interestingly, technology is not the limiting factor in the implementation of such large-scale circular projects. The challenge is in the interdisciplinary and collaborative nature of such initiatives, as companies, municipalities, wastewater treatment facilities, governments and food production parties have to align and work together, early in the design process. 
This is also the reason why we, as a private sector party, see tremendous value in joining the UN Water Conference. We want to help pave the path and contribute to the SDGs future by looking beyond our own discipline. If we manage to join cross-sectoral hands we can really elevate circularity within the food-water-energy nexus and take it to another level, together. After the conference, we want to continue to create awareness on the possibilities that are found through collaboration with the greenhouses industry, in addition to further developing water-saving technologies through our Research & Development department.",,"Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 11, Goal 12, Goal 14, Goal 15","2.1 , 2.3, 2.4 , 3.9, 6.3, 7.2, 7.3, 11.6, 12.2, 12.4, 12.5, 14.1, 14.3, 15.1, 15.3, 15.5","Tue, 02/28/2023 - 12:00","Sun, 12/31/2028 - 12:00",,0.125,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

            The establishment of a biennial YDPA conference","Civil society, youth organisations, UN member states, international organizations, and the private sector","Switzerland, United States of America",Global,"Recognizing that meaningful youth engagement is key to jointly accelerate SDG 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and SDG 13 (Climate Action), the United International Federation of Youth for Water and Climate (UN1FY) was mandated by the co-hosts of the United Nations 2023 Water Conference (Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Republic of Tajikistan) to develop the Water and Climate Youth Development Plan and Agenda (YDPA). 
As the major output of UN1FY, the YDPA consolidated the inputs of young people for the United Nations 2023 Water Conference. Specifically, the YDPA seeks to highlight youth perceptions, evaluate their level of awareness regarding water and climate issues, identify key challenges in water and climate, and formulate recommendations in the form of actionable Policies, Projects, Programs, and Activities (3PAs).  
The YDPA was drafted with a sound methodology, with an emphasis on being evidence-based and data-driven. The drafting and synthesis process of the YDPA is also consultative and representative. The collective youth position towards water and climate challenges was derived through a global survey with 4500+ responses. This was complemented by several instances of validation and enrichment with young people in international conferences, such as the Dushanbe Water Process and the 27th Conference of the Parties (COP27).  
Taken together, the YDPA provides a concrete plan of action and strategy for the adoption and implementation by all stakeholders, including UN member states (governments), international organizations, the private sector, civil society, academia, and youth, in order to help transform water and climate ambition into action. The Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) mechanism is presented in three components: (1) Secretariat Independent M&E, (2) Stakeholders M&E, and (3) Consolidated Annual M&E, which consolidates (1) and (2) in order to serve as a feedback mechanism. The implementation and follow-up processes of the YDPA are expected to be supported by the following recommendations: (1) the institutionalization of a youth-focused Secretariat, (2) the creation of a Water and Climate Support Fund, and (3) the establishment of a biennial conference. 
UN1FY commits to overseeing the above engagements to the extent that the requisite financial and institutional support is provided by UN agencies and UN member states.","In the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the interdependence between SGD 6 (Clean Water and Sanitation) and 13 (Climate Action) cannot be overstated. For one, the impacts of climate change have further intensified stress on water sources. The intensified hydrological cycle has changed the global precipitation, patterns leading to intense and frequent droughts, extreme flooding, erratic rainfall patterns, declining snow reservoirs, and glaciers (WMO, 2022) – with cascading effects on the vulnerable populations, including women, children, and young people worldwide who are bearing the brunt of these crises more than ever. 
Furthermore, water management is central to climate action. The increasing rise of adaptation and resilience in the climate agenda has opened the door for water to be a medium of resilience. For example, the IPCC’s 2022 AR6 report called for the majority of adaptation and resilience efforts to be “water based”. Furthermore, increased water stress and meeting future demands will require increasingly difficult decisions about how to allocate water resources between competing water uses, including for climate change mitigation and adaptation (UN-Water, 2019). 
The YDPA is born from the urgent and pressing need to integrate water and climate in the same conversation, with a focus on youth empowerment. Pivoting in the youth perceptions towards water and climate challenges, the YDPA identifies the key barriers in youth participation, and formulates stakeholder-specific recommendations in the form of actionable Policies, Programs, Projects, and Activities (3PAs). 
The 3PAs are organized in eight pillars of action, each of which has a specific goal.  Specifically, two pillars provide enabling conditions (youth representation, financing and finance), three pillars are led by non-youth stakeholders (capacity development, data-knowledge generation and innovation, governance and management), and three pillars are led by youth stakeholders (influence and advocacy, networking and partnerships, direct action). Furthermore, the 3PAs are categorized into four tiers of youth empowerment, which are awareness, participation, empowered action, and leadership. As young people move up the tiers, they become more empowered, increasing their capacity to be agents of change. Accordingly, they can exercise greater impact and influence in the water and climate sector, contributing to SDG6 and SDG13 targets.  
Finally, the YDPA acknowledges the need for national governments to set their context-specific SDG 6 and SDG13 targets, and incorporate them into national planning processes, policies, and strategies by taking into account local circumstances and baseline conditions. To this end, the YDPA was designed with a specific strategy for commitment-building, and contains a roadmap for implementation from 2023 to 2030.","Water and Climate Coalition, World Meteorological Organization, YOUNGO – Official Children and Youth Constituency of the UNFCCC, Major Group for Children and Youth, Global Youth Movement on Water","Goal 6, Goal 13, Goal 17","6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.a, 13.b, 17.9, 17.14, 17.16, 17.17, 17.18","Sat, 01/01/2022 - 12:00","Sun, 12/31/2028 - 12:00",Developing effective and meaningful partnerships is a critical priority for UN1FY to unlock the power of international and intergenerational collaboration.

In Africa, even 60 per cent of people lack coverage. We want to contribute to the “Early Warning for all” ambition and accelerate the development of effective multi-hazard early warning systems in Africa. 
Publicly available satellite data and (global) forecasting models, can better support African governments for Early Warning purposes. Once these global datasets are enhanced with local information (e.g. ground observations), local forecasts become reliable and more accurate. This simultaneously increases the understanding of African weather systems and its response to water bodies, given the effect of climate change and increasingly extreme weather change. We will therefor look at:
•	coastal zones;
•	urban areas;
•	large river systems;
•	tropical cyclones.
We belief that the technical implementation of these locally enhanced global forecasts can best be executed by African national governmental organizations themselves; the meteorological services, hydrological services, marine institutes, and national disaster management organizations. This will enable them to independently maintain and develop these systems further afterwards. The Dutch water sector has extensive knowledge and expertise in international flood forecasting and water management. We, HKV and Deltares, offer to support these institutions with our expertise. We invite other organizations in the whole spectrum of Early Warning, such as meteorological agencies, humanitarian sector, universities, governmental institutions, and NGO’s, to join us by contributing their expertise to this initiative. 
We belief that capacity development works best when focused on young professionals. We want to bring young experts (below the age of 40) from African organizations together to jointly develop early warning systems. This provides them the opportunity to establish an international network and boost their careers. At the same time, we bring in young Dutch experts (below the age of 40) to ensure a bottom-up approach.  
Our aim is that within 5 years most of our African partners can disseminate accurate and reliable Early Warnings in-time, without being dependent on the support of developed countries (like The Netherlands).","This action is new because it proposes a bottom-up approach where young African professionals are the starting point of the initiative. This action adds value because it is focused on the African continent where 60% of the people still lack coverage of Early Warning. We believe this initiative facilitates: Early Warning for All. 
The devastating impacts of natural hazards can be mitigated by structural as well as non-structural measures. The implementation of structural measures generally takes a long time and requires significant financial investments. Non-structural measures, such as Early Warning systems, can be very effective in reducing the impacts and can be implemented much faster. The contribution to water safety can therefore be significant as many people and sectors can benefit from Early Warnings.
Young professionals in Africa will be at the steering wheel of the initiative and become the corner stone of the African Young Water Professional Network. This will also generate positive impact in their own region increasing skills on leading the process towards Early Warning for all in Africa. This Network is open to other countries, so once it becomes successful, other countries and institutes are invited to participate in the activities and benefit from the experiences gained. The initial focus is on coastal floods and flash floods using openly available and easily accessible data and information. Later, this can be expanded to riverine flooding, cyclones, droughts or other types of natural hazards.
This action contributes to the following SDG:
•	SDG 6: Clean water and sanitation, since early warning does increase resilience of vital infrastructure
•	SDG 11: Sustainable cities and communities, since early warning does increase resilience and climate adaptation in urban areas.
•	SDG 13: Climate action, with climate change extreme events become more frequent and more severe, early warning is an effective way of risk reduction.

The Niger River Basin is home to an estimated 160 million people across 9 riparian countries. Heavy reliance on already degraded natural resources, combined with chronic conflicts and the effects of climate change, make it one of the poorest, most food insecure and fragile river basins in the world. The reliance on ecosystem services provided by the Niger River and its important protected areas is high. Over 70% of the population live in rural areas where food production depends on unreliable rainfall and highly variable and declining inter- and intra-annual river flows, while at the same time agriculture uses 85% of freshwater withdrawals across the basin. Integrated Water Resource Management (IWRM) in the Niger Basin can provide effective solutions for climate change adaptation (CCA) and mitigation (CCM) in what is one of the most impoverished and vulnerable river systems in the world. Increasing climate variability threatens agricultural production and water security in West and Central Africa. The project strengthens the Niger Basin Authority (NBA) and its member countries, allowing them to mainstream CCA and CCM into regional planning, implementation and monitoring mechanisms. A transboundary approach encompassing IWRM, wetland restoration and management as well as climate smart agriculture offers solutions which national adaptation and mitigation strategies alone may not be able to deliver. The project will trigger a transformation in view of how the Niger River basin is governed and how user groups can overcome resource conflicts in a critical part of the Sahel region. It will implement regional CCA and CCM through a coherent learning and replication approach based on the results in the three selected transboundary sub-basins (“lighthouses”). This will be supported by the direct link to upscaling mechanisms, such as the Regional Fund for Climate Change Adaptation (FRACC) and will enable Member Countries to create shared benefits from an agreed financial and management mechanism. The project will focus specifically on three transboundary tributaries to the Niger river: the Sankarani, Mekrou and Benue sub-basins.","The project aims to improve implementation of transboundary IWRM measures for CCA and CCM in the Niger basin, which will drive long-term positive impacts on the resilience of livelihoods and ecosystems in the basin and on reduction / avoidance of GHGs emissions. This is achieved through increased capacities of relevant institutions and decisionmakers (output 1), availability of successful transboundary and climate-smart IWRM solutions (output 2) combined with better use and access to information and evidence-based planning tools (output 3) and the availability of mechanisms for upscaling transboundary IWRM and Water-Energy-Food (WEF) Nexus approaches that directly target climate change adaptation and mitigation (output 4). The WEF Nexus approach is a paradigm shift, away from a separate and sectoral approach in managing water, food and energy and towards supplying these resources amongst sectors by strengthening synergies and reducing trade-offs. Reaching actual transboundary agreements on cost and benefit sharing will be a substantive innovation, overcoming use and management conflicts in the basin. Involvement of local SMEs in the development of climate-adaptive business cases and a “Women and Youth Innovation Award” are further elements that are new in the region.

            Upscale of network achievements globally (at least 10 countries)","Beneficiaries of our joint Voluntary Commitment are all the water training and education centres globally, mobilised through the global network available at Partner institutions.",Sweden,Global,"The Alliance commits to support the establishment of stronger links between organizations at a global level delivering education and capacity development (CD) services with a special focus on water education and in support of the achievement of the SDG6 and all other water related SDGs.
This commitment will contribute to a more structural way to develop CD support to countries and provide substantial support to the Capacity Development Initiative (CDI) coordinated by UNESCO and UN DESA, with the support of the Alliance. We consider CD and the CDI as the main accelerator within the Global Accelerator Framework as strong capacities are needed to support also the other accelerators: Governance, Financing, Data & Information, and Innovation.
In particular, the Alliance commits to be a facilitator among existing training centers and CD networks active globally and especially in the Global South, in the countries/regions of concern.
The Alliance recognizes that effective CD is achieved by responding to needs on the ground through practical tools, tailored approaches, iterative measures for lifelong learning and curated knowledge products.
CD is one of the key instruments to addressing the complexity of water issues – focusing on inter-disciplinarily, systems thinking, problem analysis, from the individual to institutional levels. It needs to be systemic, long-term, and forward-looking, and requires local ownership for sustainability beyond any initiative. What is key to staying relevant is responding to a changing development landscape and the evolving needs of countries and partners. A process-oriented approach to CD for systemic change will require different approaches, for example prioritizing the development of skills which are needed to improve the governance of water such as leadership, communication, stakeholder engagement and coordination, planning & preparedness, coordination, MEL (monitoring, evaluation, and learning), data management, considering always the specific social and political norms and expectations of a particular context.
We continue to promote broad participation and engagement, analyzing the barriers to representation of all stakeholders in water, from women to indigenous communities.CD initiatives have the greatest potential of supporting vulnerable groups as active decision-makers in the otherwise heavily male-dominated arena of water decision-making, paying special attention to youths, social innovation, citizen science and the future generations of world water leaders.
With this commitment, the Alliance is not planning to create new water networks or replacing existing coordination mechanism, but serving as a central point of coordination and facilitation to improve even further the impact of these networks and partnerships, in line with the principles outlined in SDG17 “Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the Global Partnership for Sustainable Development”.","The Alliance commits to accelerate impact in particular by providing key support to the Capacity Development Accelerator by:
•	Supporting a common understanding and encourage alignment on CD concepts and processes.
•	Serving as a forum to offer specific instruments to implement the UN-Water Capacity Development Initiative, with a focus not only on the capacity of individuals but also at the level of organizations, institutions and in consideration of the enabling environment.
•	Serving as a mechanism for sharing lessons learned, trends, and information on existing programmes (useful to avoid duplication of efforts).
•	Supporting identification of resources to help implementing of CD activities, especially by using local experience hence contributing to more sustainable and long-term CD efforts.
•	Supporting the creation of agreed upon Curricula and their revisions, and in addition make available open online courses and training material.
•	Serving as a platform to discuss innovation in education and a consistent use in approaching knowledge sharing with the most state-of-the-art tools and instruments.
•	Fostering capacity development in the use of technologies for sustainable water management.
•	Discussion and advocacy on Financing capacity development.
•	Leveraging and bridging of existing alumni and capacity development networks to reach out to local stakeholders.
•	Making available online courses on water education, training materials, and multi-lingual and quality virtual campus for online and blended capacity development.
•	Supporting innovative monitoring, evaluation, and learning of capacity development interventions, by using more qualitative impact evaluation techniques (e.g. story telling).
•	Supporting better communication mechanisms within and outside the networks, to ensure all perspectives are considered. Improved communication will involve also simplifying the messages for e.g. decision makers","IHE Delft submits this voluntary commitment also on behalf of an Alliance of supporting organizations, namely Cap-Net UNDP and the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI).","Goal 6, Goal 17","6.a, 17.6, 17.16",,,,0.125,0.3333333333333333,0.25,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

In the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), rapid population growth, overexploitation of natural resources and the impacts of climate change require balancing key objectives such as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, the conservation of carbon sinks and other ecosystems, the resilience and well-being of local communities and the development of the country's vital sectors. Water is the link between all these objectives and the establishment of integrated water resources management in the DRC is paramount to achieving the national ambitions for economic, social and environmental development. A better understanding of these complex interrelationships and a balance between the needs of the various stakeholders, the water demands of the different sectors and local policy decisions are needed. The project aims to establish and implement a Nexus approach between integrated water resources management, conservation of ecosystems and their services for climate change mitigation and adaptation, and the multiple uses of water that are important for the country's development, such as green energy supply (the Water-Energy-Ecosystem Nexus, in short WEEN). The project follows a multi-level governance approach: at national, sub-basin and local level. At the national level, the strengthening of decision-makers with a key role in the implementation of Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM), and their cooperation with the Ministries of Energy and Environment will be supported. In agreement with and at the request of the relevant stakeholders, the project will be able to offer assistance to the Congolese Government to accede to the United Nations Water Convention. At the level of a 'flagship' sub-basin, the project will support the establishment of an information system to improve the database for evidence-based decision making. The project promotes the introduction of innovative technologies, tools and methodologies for integrated water resources management. This approach will enhance long-term sustainability, climate resilience and GHG mitigation in the sub-basin, while improving framework conditions such as the accurate and timely provision of relevant data. Good practices and expertise will be promoted through exchange at national and international level and embedded in the institutional structures of national stakeholders. To accelerate the implementation of climate-sensitive IWRM and WEEN approaches at national, sub-basin and local levels, increased resilience against climate change and enhanced adaptation capacity will be enabled through: improved availability and sharing of data and information (output 1), strengthened capacity and skills for data analysis and decision-making (output 2), improved multi-sectoral coordination mechanisms (output 3) as well as improved framework conditions for scaling-up (output 4).","The project supports the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development of the Democratic Republic of Congo in the implementation of its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) to achieve the climate objectives of the Paris Agreement (2015), the National Climate Adaptation Plan (2022-2026) and the National Strategic Development Plan (2032-2027). The project is expected to bring about a paradigm shift away from a separate and sector-oriented approach towards a holistic view of the complexity of all natural resources, reflecting the interlinkages between water resources and relevant ecosystems, and thus promoting synergies and reducing trade-offs. Both IWRM and WEEN approaches will be central to supporting actors at national, sub-basin and local levels to ensure that enhanced long-term resilience against the impacts of climate change is safeguarded, while the mitigation objectives and development needs of the target population (e.g. access to sustainable energy, food and water security, poverty reduction) are met. The involvement of local civil society organisations as well as the private sector will be crucial for substantial innovation, overcoming use and management conflicts in the selected sub-basin. The project will particularly address the needs and challenges of women and vulnerable groups (indigenous people and youth) and strengthen their role in the implementation of the IWRM approach through active participation in the decision-making process at local and sub-basin level. The project contributes to low-carbon development, increased resilience to climate change and enhanced adaptation capacity (SDG 13), protects and conserves biodiversity and ecosystem services in the selected sub-basin (SDG 15), contributes to the sustainable supply and management of water (SDG 6) and energy (SDG 7) resources for the population, and places particular emphasis on the involvement of women (SDG 5) as well as vulnerable groups.",National and provincial service providers River basin agencies Local communities Non-governmental organisations Scientific community,"Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 13, Goal 15",,"Tue, 08/01/2023 - 12:00","Fri, 07/31/2026 - 12:00","The commitment contributes to Themes 2 (Water for Sustainable Development) and 3 (Water for Climate, Resilience, and Environment) of the UN 2023 Water Conference and addresses all 5 accelerators under the SDG 6 Global Acceleration Framework.",0.0,0.4444444444444444,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1098901098901103

Piloted new forms of science communication through 20 international youth organizations, universities, businesses, and civil society organizations by enhancing understanding and empathy and reinforcing empirical knowledge about water with expertise.
This dialogue method has already been introduced in universities, civic groups, and high schools, and it is possible to proceed both online and face-to-face.
As a method, first, a theme is presented by an expert, and words and analyses related to the theme are submitted to the participants using sticky notes. Next, participants share knowledge based on their experiences written on each sticky note. It also strengthens awareness of water use by providing expert knowledge to the respective empirical knowledge of experts once a certain amount of sharing has progressed. After knowledge sharing by experts, participants will delve into their own experiences based on knowledge from experts. Finally, each participant will share how they will proceed with their activities in the future, and deepen the improvement of water resource management with each other. These activities can be carried out in 60 to 90 minutes, and are designed so that the expected number of participants is 6 to 50 so that they can proceed smoothly.
The advantage of environmental education centered on water through this two-way dialogue is that it is easy for participants to acquire knowledge that is easy to incorporate into their daily lives by sharing experiences among participants in a short time and reinforcing knowledge by experts. be. Another advantage is that sharing the opinions of each participant leads to active learning, which can easily lead to an active understanding of water in the future. On top of that, not only the participants will learn, but also the experts will develop new hypotheses based on the participants' experiences and knowledge of droughts and floods, as well as promote an understanding of the characteristics of the land. You can acquire useful knowledge for updating flood control hazard maps, etc. In this way, environmental education on water through this two-way dialogue is an opportunity for each to acquire new knowledge, and each has great merit.
This method is already available online and can be used with any age group. Therefore, it is possible to carry out this social dialogue without being restricted by time, place, or necessary materials, so it can be said that the feasibility is extremely high. It is also possible to raise the awareness of water among all citizens in a short time by introducing it into school education and recurrent education, and it is possible to implement any form. In addition, experts related to water resource management are not only experts who research water issues scientifically, but also citizens who deal with themes related to floods and droughts described in history, culture, and literature.","We have already held a total of 15 lectures since November using the ""Environmental Café,"" an interactive social dialogue method like the one submitted in the Impact Report, with a total of more than 800 people participating in face-to-face meetings. In Japan, a project is being built to increase opportunities for the exchange of opinions between experts and citizens, and youth in cooperation with the National Institute for Environmental Studies and JICA, which developed this method. This method of social dialogue promoting activities that take into account flood control and water resource management and the risks of drought and flooding due to climate change in a short 90-minute period, and 60% of those who participated had more understanding and empathy after the workshop than they would have after a regular lecture.
In Indonesia, our method of education was adopted as the best proposal for TDMRC's Young Pro DRR program, which will promote collaboration with experts in water resources management in disaster education. In Japan, China, and Korea, we will introduce our approach as a case study of advanced efforts by young people at the Trilateral Cooperation Secretariat (TCS), an international organization that facilitates cooperation between each country. The workshop was led by young people to discuss the initiatives for water resources management on international rivers in their respective countries. In India, through collaboration with the Tapananda Rural Development Society, which conducts engineering education in cooperation with universities and research institutions, it was decided to conduct an online program to foster a common understanding of flood control in Bangladesh, India, and Vietnam through this ""Environment Café. The program has already been implemented online and on demand. A total of 1,400 young people have already attended the online and on-demand lectures, learning how to manage water resources in their daily lives and how flood and drought damage can be controlled through disaster prevention and infrastructure. The exchange of views with the Mekong River Commission in India, Thailand, Sri Lanka, Vietnam, and other countries through their embassies has also led to the education of engineers and the establishment of unified infrastructure technology standards for a framework to build sustainable industries for the purpose of climate adaptation and infrastructure facilities. This has led to the establishment of a unified infrastructure technology standard. And at this year's Asia Pacific Forum for Sustainable Development (APFSD), not only will our activities at the Youth Forum lead to a direct introduction to decision-makers in the Asia Pacific region, but the longstanding conflict between the Mekong River Commission and China also succeeded in setting the location of the negotiations as the plenary session of the APFSD, and in setting up an exchange of views to promote the development of sustainable social infrastructure in the wider region.
Thus, the implementation potential of our efforts is spreading beyond Japan to areas in the Asia-Pacific region where we can already work, and is being realized by international organizations, international conferences, and several NGOs and government agencies.","Climate Youth Japan, National Institution for Environmental Studies","Goal 4, Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 11, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 14, Goal 15, Goal 16, Goal 17",,"Sun, 06/07/2020 - 12:00","Sat, 07/06/2030 - 12:00","UNEP Faith for Earth Youth Council

            Regular Youth Training Session on the Subject","After successful initiative in Pakistan the scope of operation will further be increased to African countries like Nigeria, Liberia, Guinea etc.",Pakistan,Asia and Pacific,"Floods are one of the most common natural disasters in Pakistan. Due to the country's geographic location, low-lying areas are highly vulnerable to flood risks. Floods caused extensive damage to infrastructure, livelihoods, and the environment. Nature-based solutions (NBS) for flood risk management can provide effective, sustainable, and cost-efficient solutions to mitigate flood risks in Pakistan. This presentation provides an overview of nature-based solutions for flood risk management in Pakistan.
What are Nature-Based Solutions (NBS)?
Nature-based solutions (NBS) are actions that protect, sustainably manage, and restore natural and modified ecosystems to address societal challenges. NBS can help to mitigate the negative impacts of floods, such as erosion, sedimentation, and loss of vegetation cover. NBS can provide benefits for both people and the environment.
NBS for Flood Risk Management in Pakistan
The following are some nature-based solutions that can be used for flood risk management in Pakistan:
1. Reforestation and afforestation
Reforestation and afforestation can be effective nature-based solutions for flood risk management in Pakistan. Planting trees and restoring forest cover can help to reduce the runoff and soil erosion, regulate water flow, and improve soil structure. Reforestation can also provide other benefits such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, and livelihood improvement.
2. Wetland restoration
Wetland restoration can help to mitigate flood risks in Pakistan. Wetlands act as natural buffers against flooding by absorbing and storing water, reducing peak flows, and filtering pollutants. Restoring degraded wetlands can provide multiple benefits such as improving water quality, enhancing biodiversity, and providing recreational opportunities.
3. Sustainable land management
Sustainable land management practices can help to reduce flood risks in Pakistan. These practices include soil conservation, terracing, contour farming, and crop diversification. Sustainable land management can help to reduce soil erosion, increase soil water holding capacity, and improve crop productivity. These practices can also help to reduce the impact of floods on agricultural lands and improve the resilience of farming communities.
4. Green infrastructure
Green infrastructure can be an effective nature-based solution for flood risk management in Pakistan. Green infrastructure includes natural or engineered features such as green roofs, rain gardens, and permeable pavements. These features can help to reduce runoff, increase infiltration, and improve water quality. Green infrastructure can also provide other benefits such as improving urban aesthetics, enhancing biodiversity, and reducing the urban heat island effect.
Benefits of NBS for Flood Risk Management in Pakistan
The following are some benefits of using nature-based solutions for flood risk management in Pakistan:
Cost-effective: NBS can be more cost-effective than traditional infrastructure-based approaches to flood risk management.
Multiple benefits: NBS can provide multiple benefits such as carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, and livelihood improvement.
Resilience: NBS can improve the resilience of ecosystems and communities to flood risks.
Adaptability: NBS can be adapted to different environmental and social contexts.","Nature-based solutions for flood risk management will impact and provide effective, sustainable, and cost-efficient solutions to mitigate flood risks in Pakistan. Reforestation and afforestation, wetland restoration, sustainable land management, and green infrastructure are some of the nature-based solutions will impact largely. Our Water Action Agenda will provide multiple benefits and improve the resilience of ecosystems and communities to flood risks.","Riverside Development Organization Pakistan

Starting active campaigns about the issue of women and customary people of victims living in the PT.Freeport mine ring area in the mountainous area and the coastal area of Timika due to mining damage where the company discarded the tailing industry waste without clear procedures. About 6000 people in the coastal area are still alive Without clean water. This number includes 30 percent of the total population. Most of them live in a remote coastal area that takes about 6-8 hours to row a canoe to get clean water from the river at least once every two days. Even then, the water they got was not necessarily safe because it was close to the area of PT Freeport's gold mine tailings waste disposal area that had been disposed of its waste since 54 years ago to Sungau Wanogong or Ajkwa. The environment around the village has been unhealthy since the Sugai-Sungai became shallow and turned into a poisonous land due to the largest rock and sand puddles in the world. Women and children are forced to find water and take up their time to take care of their families, work and go to school. Many children in the village drop out of school. Suffering due to environmental destruction is mixed with the impact of climate change which makes it more difficult for people to find income from the sea.
The focus of our commission is to advocate the community in 23 villages and 3 sub -districts affected by Freeport tailings. My friends and I established this community since 2013, 10 years ago. What we do is documentation, research, campaign, and mediation. Our goal is that Freeport and the government see the impact of their work. We are now losing rivers, forests, small islands, sacred forests and also livelihoods and the culture of the community. They have the responsibility to rehabilitate the damage they caused. Adolfina works by advocating the community affected by tailings pollution, women victims in the mine and female victims on the coast, rivers in 23 villages are now damaged and cannot be used for transportation or livelihoods, and women face the water crisis to support their needs .

For its addition we will work primarily on the construction of 54.421 km of water infrastructure connected to the public network and at the same time on training the population on hygiene, prevention and management of the common good, on the construction of 100 pilot ecological latrines, on the launch of health insurance mutual groups to facilitate access to medical care for all.
A combination of several modalities will achieve the final change:
1) Make resources available in the community, mainly through the construction of drinking water supply infrastructures.
2) Raising awareness/training of beneficiaries with three main goals:
- Behavioral change in hygiene and sanitation practices. This will be about highlight the harmful effects of poor hygiene and sanitation practices for then take corrective action. Latrines are actually not sufficient in quantity and quality. The first step will be to raise awareness to build latrines that do not pollute the environment. Then we will set up ecological latrines, so that the community could takes the example. This system protects the environment and allows the transformation of human waste into fertilizers of the ground.
There is no mechanism for processing and managing household waste. We will sensitize the population for a better household waste management and conduct household sensitization to the hygiene of the habitat to then contribute to the reduction of the diseases related to the insalubrity.
-Participation in the management of community assets: awareness/training will be carried out on the management of common good, water and drinking water supply infrastructure. It will be about understanding what a common good is, how to manage it, what are the conflicts that can arise around it and what is the best way to manage them. This will allow the maintenance of infrastructures and the prevention of conflicts and therefore the project sustainability and social cohesion.
-Community health mutuals: given that in the community, there are few health facilities and access to health care remains difficult due to the lack of financial means, joining community health mutuals will be a added value in access to health care. The secret is the social welfare in health. It's about contributing to a fund health insurance that, in the event of illness, covers a large part of the cost of care and the patient pays only the co-payment often very affordable (between 20 and 40%). This alleviates the cost burden of care and care services in households.
3) Capacity building of project implementation staff:  In order to improve local skills, the implementation team will be strengthened in the management of development projects. Local staff will participate in training on project management and common good; this will allow to appropriate the content of the training, to become themselves agents of change in the management of the common good, but also to be able to monitor the implementation of the theme in the community.","This action mainly contributes to Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) No. 6 which is that of “Guaranteeing access to water and sanitation for all and ensuring effective management of sustainable water resources"".
Working in an area where the water resource is available, the action aims to contribute to the achievement of this objective by facilitating access for populations to drinking water and the protection of water resources. In order to ensure the sustainability of the resource, the project will promote the participation of beneficiaries and key authorities in management of this resource at the municipal level.
This action also contributes to the SDG n° 3 which is to “Enable everyone to live in good health and promote the well-being of all
all ages"". It is about providing the means to live a healthy life and promote the well-being of all at all ages, which is essential for sustainable development. Access to drinking water is a means of improving health; the two prerequisites, water and health being basic conditions
to achieve this last objective. In particular, this dimension of the health of the population is also taken up in the texts fundamentals such as the Constitution of the Republic of Burundi, Social Security Codes, Vision 2025 (pillar II), CSLPII (axis IV), the National Development Plan (PND), the National Policy for Social Protection PNPS (2011) and in its SNPS implementation strategy (2015).
Given that community health mutuals are part of the national policy of social protection is a means of implementing one of the four pillars of the protection floor which are: (i) access to health care for all, (ii) access to income for children, (iii) access to income for active unemployed people and (iv) access to income for elderly and disabled people. The social protection code currently being revised gives a place of choice for community health mutuals as a mechanism for setting up universal health insurance. Community health mutuals that are already in operation work closely with the line ministry, the Ministry of Social Affairs, Human Rights
And Gender through the permanent executive secretariat of the National Commission for Social Protection (SEP/CNPS) set up in 2012.
This action falls well within the priorities of the Government expressed in national policy documents, such as:

Aligned to the principles of Locally Led Adaptation, the Water Justice Funds aims to realise systemic change whereby groups most affected by climate change, get agency and resources to take those measures they believe are the best for their context.  
The existing and future challenges in the field of water require innovative and transformative ideas. Adaptation actions do not automatically have positive outcomes for gender equality. Efforts are needed to change unequal power dynamics and to foster inclusive decision-making for climate adaptation to have a positive impact for gender equality.  
With the Water Justice Fund, Simavi and partners want to support locally-led climate actions that protect water sources, strengthen Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH), or lead to more equitable water access in contexts of (acute and anticipated) scarcity. By focusing on gender justice, the fund aims to support and create more opportunities for feminist leadership in climate adaptation. 
The Water Justice Fund, initiated by CSOs from Global South and North sets out to achieve five key outcomes:   
1. Catalyze and advance localized gender just climate financing – increasing the flows of resources to the local level;  
2. Strengthen household and community level climate resilience, including the promotion of Human Rights to Water and Sanitation (HRWS);  
3. Strengthen the durability of grassroot organizing and in particular the organizing of women and girls for greater voice, participation, influence and agency, networks, and movement building;  
4. Promote gender equality and transformation by seeking to actively identify and remove the discriminatory barriers that women and girls face in accessing resources and decision-making;  
5. Fill knowledge and evidence gaps of strategic stakeholders in order to influence policy and programming related to locally-led adaptation actions of rural women and girls. ","Climate change is expected to further intensify water-related challenges and widen existing inequities in water access. In nearly all regions in the world women and children are disproportionately responsible for securing water and food for their households, leaving them particularly vulnerable when water becomes scarce or insecure. Water is essential to the economic and social position of women – where durable access to water can bring a cascade of positive effects on women’s economic and social lives, as well as on their health and that of their families and communities (1). Despite this, less than 1% of the billions pledged (2) to address climate change go towards supporting water services for poor communities (3). Lack of gender responsive and durable climate funding for local civil society organizations further reinforces the exclusion of women and other marginalized groups in decision-making and climate action (4), leaving existing global and local systems of inequalities largely intact. It is the force of the climate’s impact on women, combined with existing poor water and sanitation services, that is at the core of the Water Justice Fund.   
The Water Justice Fund supports the UN Action Agenda and the SDG 6 Acceleration Framework and aims to accelerate progress in the following ways:    
- Locally led- Adaptation Principles: The fund strengthens local organizing on the nexus of WASH, climate adaptation and gender equality. At the local level there are no sectoral divides or boundaries – water, sanitation, hygiene and climate must be approached holistically in order to have concrete impacts on the lives of women and girls experiencing water insecurity.   
- The Water Crisis fundamentally affects women. Durable access to water will bring a cascade of benefits to the social and economic position of women. The fund creates spaces and opportunities for leadership of women and girls in water and climate solutions. Inclusive and sustainable WASH access is a prerequisite to meeting the global goals related to gender equality (SDG 5) and climate action (SDG 13).   
- Mobilising grassroot networks to influence decision making and strengthening accountability to realise SDG 6. The Water Justice Fund supports grassroot climate and water activists globally to  make sure policies and practices are inclusive, and financial investments leave no one behind.","Simavi, and Women Win, Uttaran, Neighbours Initiatives Alliance (NIA), Sahakarmi Samaj","Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 13","5.1 , 5.2, 5.4 , 5.5, 5.a, 6.1 , 6.2, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 13.1","Wed, 02/01/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2030 - 12:00",https://simavi.org/en/programmes/water-justice-fund,0.625,0.6666666666666666,0.6666666666666666,0.0,1.0,0.2197802197802206

At the same time, national and international policies also have an impact on groundwater management. For instance, a large part of groundwater abstraction and contamination is embedded in goods and services that are internationally traded (virtual groundwater). Therefore, there is a need for groundwater data and information to be produced and shared at all levels, including at the regional and global levels. Unfortunately, regional and global groundwater datasets are currently limited. This has to do with the limited availability of in-situ groundwater data, such as borehole data and monitoring data, in particular in low-income countries, and with the limited sharing of existing data. 
As a UNESCO and WMO-affiliated centre, IGRAC is committed to produce global groundwater datasets and to provide an unrestricted access to these data, according to open data principles put forth by UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science (2021) and WMO Unified Data Policy Resolution (2021). These datasets will offer a reliable basis for regional and global assessments of groundwater resources, groundwater management, and the socio-economic and environmental processes involving groundwater. Among others, these datasets will support the reporting on SDG water indicators 6.3.2, 6.4.2 and 6.5.2. Open groundwater datasets will also improve the transparency and the inclusiveness of decision-making (indicators 16.6, 16.7 and 16.10). 
Regional and global datasets will rely on in-situ or expert knowledge, not on modelling or earth observations as it is often the case with global datasets. Data will be collected from governmental institutions, literature reviews (also including grey literature), as well as national and regional experts. This will require intensive and ongoing efforts. One particular challenge will be to engage with data-owning institutions and convince them to disclose the data. Original references of the data will be captured in the datasets for the sake of ownership and transparency. All datasets will be made available for visualization and download in IGRAC’s data sharing platform, the Global Groundwater Information System (GGIS): https://ggis.un-igrac.org/","This patient work of data collection, compilation and dissemination will prove useful for a wide range of applications and users who are in need of such regional and global groundwater datasets. The primary use of groundwater data will be to support the reporting of SDG indicators, in particular indicators 6.3.2, 6.4.2 and 6.5.2. More generally, regional and global datasets will allow a wide range of regional and global assessments, not only of groundwater resources and their management, but also of socio-economic and environmental issues where groundwater is entangled. As such, they will promote the integration of groundwater into global and regional societal questions (e.g. climate change, economic development, health, food security, migrations), which is currently lacking. Regional groundwater datasets will also support cooperation between countries in transboundary aquifers and river/lake basins. Moreover, global datasets will support global hydrologic models, as well as satellite-based assessments (e.g. GRACE), which require more groundwater data than what is currently available for calibration and testing. Furthermore, our efforts will hopefully inspire data-owning institutions and organizations to adopt open data policies.","Funding partner: Dutch government

In a series of six laboratory talks and a symposium on topics related to building future resilience, the ANCB aims to identify and discuss sustainable, water-related architectural and urban development projects that also take into account the (re)establishment of social and economic balance with greater socio-economic coherence through conscious water management. Invited experts will discuss the role of water in climate change mitigation: from reducing CO2 emissions and ecological footprint, to adaptation and resilience in the context of cities and states, to water as a common good from source to sea. The UN Water Conference offers the ideal starting point for exploring these pressing issues in depth in the German capital as well, and for examining the potential of architecture and planning to proactively meet the acute challenges in a European and international context. In this context, it is important to identify alternatives, develop and design them to show that what needs to be done can be done. It is necessary to mitigate the climate catastrophe and ensure a fairer distribution of resources for all through a global rethink in politics and spatial planning. This includes breaking away from one-sided, isolated and sectoral strategies towards integrative, comprehensive, circular and sustainable approaches. Water as an element, resource and infrastructure has a far-reaching impact on the living, natural and built environment that should not be underestimated. In Building a Future Planet, architects and planners will engage in an innovative exchange of knowledge with experts from the fields of environmental research, science and politics, in order to derive consequences for their work processes, planning, implementation and building projects. The goals are the creation of new networks, the innovative linking and visualisation of existing networks, communication in all areas of society as well as sensitisation and further training of the planning disciplines on ecological building with regard to water. The knowledge exchange will be communicated in public events and published as video recording and transcript. The results will be linked, indexed and made accessible in the comprehensive ANCB archive. As a result of the exchange, concrete recommendations and planning aids or thematic checklists will be extracted, developed and published.","Due to the acute climate crisis and its effects, the willingness and sense of responsibility of planners and architects to deal with ecological aspects such as water conservation, supply and recycling has increased considerably. This momentum is to be used in the present project to integrate the topic of water into planning processes and design at an early stage, as well as to increase sensitivity for the topic among all those involved in planning. Furthermore, the project aims to promote better construction in terms of resilience to flooding, water management, water conservation and hygiene. It also aims to consider water in its role as a common and economic good in order to raise awareness among policy and decision makers. Due to the broad scope of the issue, the project will involve as many sectors as possible. The topic will be presented to a broad audience at public events and will reach architects, landscape architects, urban planners and legislators via multipliers, publications and platforms. Through the involvement of politics, legislation and administration, new interfaces are to be made possible and foundations created. In doing so, the ANCB builds on many years of experience with international projects such as Water - Curse or Blessing! Encouraging Architectural Projects in Asia-Pacific (2011) as part of the Asia-Pacific Weeks and in cooperation with AXOR hansgrohe, ArchiAid: Rethinking Reconstruction (2013) with the Japanese initiative ArchiAid on reconstruction after the earthquake and tsunami disaster, and After Hurricane Sandy - Rebuild by Design (2014) on the reconstruction initiative of the US government. The series of events will bring about a new, closer connection between sectors and disciplines that have not been networked or have only been insufficiently networked to date on the topic of dealing with water in planning, design and construction.
Protagonists from the different sectors can thus formulate new insights and assistance for planners. In planning and design practice, there have been insufficient interfaces and hardly any intersectoral connections up to now, which would, however, be necessary in order to anchor the complex topic in various service phases and with various service providers/cooperation partners/consultants. The new conclusions and recommendations resulting from the exchange of knowledge are intended to integrate water-sensitive construction into planning processes in the most practicable way possible, without incurring high additional costs and considerable extra work for those involved in planning. Furthermore, the series is intended to create a basis and incentives for integrating the topic of ecological water management in construction earlier and more easily. The linking of international and national projects will also create new synergies, exchange and a head start in knowledge. To this end, the events will be held in English, if necessary, and the final publication will be produced in German and English in order to generate greater coverage and to take account of the internationalisation of the offices - also in terms of their staff.","Henk Ovink, Special Envoy for International Water Affairs, The Netherlands and curator of the UN Water conference

            Global stakeholders and local actors' works benefit from the various existing data systems",Global,"Burkina Faso, Central African Republic, Côte d'Ivoire, Fiji, Guatemala, Indonesia, Kenya, Liberia, Mali, Mozambique, Netherlands, Niger, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Global Action Plan, Uganda, United States of America",Global,"Data is essential to accelerating our progress towards SDG 6, measuring impact in the water sector, and driving the global economy. It has often been said that data is the new oil, but this comparison is imperfect. In addition, the idea of comparing data with fossil fuel at a time when sustainability is more important than ever seems outdated. So what about data as the new water? Coincidence or not, they share a vocabulary, both using words such as flow, pipeline, leakages, and (data) lakes. Current challenges and trends in both sectors require a completely different approach: a radical shake-up in how water is governed, managed and valued, from local to global scale, including a re-evaluation of human and natural water needs. This starts by managing water and information differently: we propose to approach water data as a common good.

At Akvo, we have 15 years of experience in data and information for water management. Much like the water sector, we started by focusing our efforts on developing infrastructure around data. Five years ago, we developed a methodology to highlight the data management steps needed for a data system to work, with a focus on creating impact with data. Together with our partners, we are now developing approaches to data governance and ecosystems approaches around data. We develop digital maturity assessments to move our partners toward more impact with data for better water resource and infrastructure monitoring and planning. We especially focus on bringing local engagement around data and information systems, as well as local data services, involving the whole data ecosystem for global impact. The information systems needed to engage at local (outcome) level involve:

Equitable resource allocation
	Sustainable water management
	Drought and flood resilience
	Climate WASH resilience
	Integrated Water Resource management
For each type of information needed, Akvo develops data services for global impact, as well as tech and capacity building at local level. ","With an ecosystem approach and data sharing strategies, IWRM and WASH actors will be able to hold each other accountable, and to ensure that water resource data and information arising from one user/influence group is made readily available to others, as well as to the public, where appropriate. Local communities and governments play a vital role in this new approach, and a solid social contract between communities, governments and citizens is crucial. Trust, communication and information, but also participatory and inclusive decision making, are key topics.

Well structured accessible data will have a positive impact on the management and steering of programmes using real/near time data, accountability and reporting on investment, communication to stakeholders, and data-driven learning. It will also support data-driven proof of programmes at outcome and impact level. Akvo supports this by enabling:

Reliable and timely data to use the scarce (financial) resources we have in the most effective way
	Inclusion by targeting the most deprived people; and
	More coordinated monitoring of the sector to efficiently invest.
In order to be able to develop sustainable planning and efficient resource allocation, all actors in the water sector need a set of timely and accurate information. Different data systems can provide information like reporting and M&E mechanisms, national monitoring and budgeting for WASH services management.

For water resource management, information systems about water allocation and stakeholder-needs should help decision makers to plan investments and prioritise resource allocation. For building resilience, information management about extreme hazard events, floods, droughts and prediction support, etc. requires better planning and preparedness to mitigate extreme hazard events.

When information is made available and main stakeholders take more efficient decisions on scarce funding resources (e.g. from policy makers, to civil society and/or funding agencies), they are likely to achieve better outcomes, increase return on investment, and improve programme efficiency and management.

 

In the long term, investments are needed in a comprehensive and coordinated multi-sector approach so that water data can be accurate, open, shared and reused to achieve maximum impact. We aim to offer services that provide value in the long run, for citizens and governments with water sector stakeholders, and aim to limit the duplication of efforts with a holistic data ecosystem approach. We use information as the anchor to enhance capacity for a better future. Eventually, each citizen is impacted by decisions on water management and thus has a role to play in deciding about their own water safety, access and decisions.

South Africa is facing a water and sanitation crisis that threatens access to basic water services and is leading to widespread pollution. This affects particularly the vulnerable population in cities. By 2030, it is projected that demand for potable water will outstrip available supply by 17%. South Africa’s water sector is highly vulnerable to climate change due to increasing water demand, institutional and capacity challenges in resource management and service delivery as well as increasing risk of droughts and floods. The water sector, through its treatment and distribution activities, is also energy intensive, making it a significant contributor to national greenhouse gas emissions. In terms of electricity consumption, water supply and wastewater treatment in South Africa represent about 25% of all municipal government electricity consumption and offer significant opportunities for energy efficiency improvements and introduction of clean energy. LCCR Water introduces adaptation and energy efficiency measures that contribute to realizing national climate change objectives and respond to vulnerable groups’ development needs. The project will make South Africa’s water and wastewater sector more resilient to climate change. By expanding water and energy resource efficiency gains, introducing clean energy, reducing water losses, strengthening management capacities in the areas of operation and finance, and raising awareness on climate resilience, water and sanitation services are enhanced, particularly for vulnerable groups. The planned sets of activities will simultaneously address technical and financial management capacities and practices in at least two secondary municipalities (200.000 to 750.000 population). The documentation of the strategy behind the interventions, the challenges during their implementation, as well as their results will provide a replicable model for additional municipalities. The project supports the Department of Water and Sanitation (DWS) to progress more rapidly, effectively and based on improved knowledge with the implementation of its National Water and Sanitation Master Plan.","LCCR Water addresses South Africa’s water crisis through technical and financial-management interventions in at least two South African municipalities while supporting high-level policy dialogue amongst key sector stakeholders. The aim is for the South African water and wastewater sector to implement measures towards the achievement of national low-carbon and climate adaptation targets, contributing particularly to improved and more resilient water and wastewater services and long-term economic development that is highly responsive to vulnerable groups. The project has three Outputs that include measures to boost resilience and more efficient water and energy resource use with regard to water supply (Output 1), wastewater treatment and sludge management (Output 2) and promotion of high-level inter-departmental dialogue on policy-relevant issues for the sector (Output 3). LCCR Water will support municipalities in conducting a stock take and prioritization of water resilience interventions, considering time, financial and human resource constraints. The measures will be aligned with the relevant development plans and budget cycles and, where applicable, municipalities will be supported in applying for funding from national or international funding mechanisms or institutions. Municipalities will be supported in identifying and addressing capacity development needs (e.g., in climate resilience, energy efficiency and clean energy, customer and financial management or in accessing national and international climate finance) through trainings, peer learning and other suitable measures. The project approach and activities to be undertaken in the targeted municipalities are designed with replicability and up-scalability in mind. All measures are implemented with involvement of national stakeholders (collaboration partners), which are positioned to apply similar approaches and measures in more municipalities. LCCR Water’s proposed impact and outcome are in line with NDC priorities for the water and energy sectors, seeking to integrate adaptation, mitigation, and development objectives. The project will evaluate the results in year three and make recommendations to its partners on options for post-project sustainability and replication.",South African Local Government Association (SALGA) Water Research Commission (WRC),"Goal 3, Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 11, Goal 13",,"Mon, 08/01/2022 - 12:00","Thu, 07/31/2025 - 12:00",,0.0,0.2222222222222222,0.6666666666666666,0.75,0.0,0.05494505494505515

The expert group would aim to investigate:
•	Language used - avoiding jargon as much as possible.
•	Methodologies for dissemination (online and offline; workshops; connecting to more local NGOs/CSO and umbrella organisations, usable by different target groups and levels of education).
•	Mapping successful approaches for getting more relevant information “on-the-ground”.
•	How to make the information even more interdisciplinary.
•	How to combine with other sources of knowledge and experience.
•	Develop capacity development modules to be used by teachers and trainers.
The development process for this would probably take 2 to 3 years.","The main outcome will be to make available water resources research and scientific knowledge more accessible for people to use in practice.

Small dam idea will also be discussed as per funds availability.",These countries will be taken as model through public private partnership and then this project will be enhanced to other countries through Government partnership.,Pakistan,Asia and Pacific,"Background and Objective: The immediate causes of the floods were heavier than usual monsoon rains and melting glaciers that followed a severe heat wave, both of which are linked to climate change. The rise in sea surface temperatures is believed to increase monsoon rainfall. In addition, southern Pakistan experienced back-to-back heat waves, which were record-setting and they made more likely by climate change. The objective of the water action agenda is to make research, feasibility at larger scale through public private collaboration to properly utilize heavy rainfalls water and flood water due to melting of glaciers. Increasing capacity to capture rainfall water and flood water through deep drilling holes i.e. wetlands in the ground & getting water into the ground. Increasing number of wetlands can facilitate these waters to be saved for future use. Implementation, Follow-up Mechanism and Governance: 1- In Province of Sindh & Balochistan through Deep penetrating well techniques, we will Save Billions Dollar value's Water Every Year. 2- In developed countries, pressurized irrigation & deep penetrating well systems are more common for horticulture (fruit trees, grape vines, vegetables), and higher-value and more-waterlogging-sensitive staple food and fiber crops such as maize, soybeans, and cotton However, a wide range of crops, including rice and wheat, and pastures are also grown under this systems. 3- Through deep well & adoption of pressurized irrigation technologies leads to significant real water savings & Soil Fertility in Higher. 4- The Structure of deep well is about 2 feet width & 100 feet depth steel small Pores net with surrounding concrete boundary. 5-Through public private partnership, Government of Pakistan should establish Deep penetrating wells (Soil drill depth - 100 ft) in Flood Flow areas on Urban & Rural Development Areas. 6- Through public private partnership, Government of Pakistan should Developed small Dams / Water Storage Areas & Sindh Barrage on urgent need basis for storage of Flood water & save this flood water drainage into Indus River. 7- Government of Pakistan should maintain this flood water into Indus river Basin through Barrages. 8- Maintenance of water level in Indus River through Barrages & In Sindh, Sindh Barrage should mandatory developed in Thatta. 9- Government of Pakistan should mobilize NGOs, Government Departments & Research Institutes to launch Plant Drive Activities.","Through wetlands water can be saved for irrigation and it will help strengthen economy through agriculture and water surface level shall rise around the lands of deep drilling holes which will not only purify water for further drinking by installing hand pumps etc but also be useful for irrigation.

The City is contributing R50 million in the 22/23 financial year to a partnership coordinated by The Nature Conservancy, which clears thirsty alien invasive plants (AIPs) so that more water reaches our dams. Climate change is a reality, and the City is taking proactive steps to ensure that our water sources are conserved and protected. Clearing of alien invasive plants is a key component of the City’s Water Strategy. By removing water-guzzling plants from key parts of the dam catchment, our surface water supply is maximised as more rain water can flow into the dams.The City recognises the importance of healthy catchments in our water future and that’s why we’ve invested actively through a multi-partnership programme, the Greater Cape Town Water Fund (GCTWF) restoring the catchments of Wemmershoek, Berg River and Steenbras dams. This was in response to scientific reports which showed that over 55 billion litres of water - about two months of water for Cape Town - was being lost every year to alien invasive plants such as pine, gum and wattle trees.
Experts estimated that this loss was set to double to 100 billion litres of water every year, within 20 years, if not addressed. This is the most cost-effective supply intervention we have as part of our diverse mix of sources we’re bringing online to ensure a more secure water supply in future. It’s estimated that Cape Town will grow substantially over the coming decades, so this is an important initiative. To turn the water losses into gains, this programme is tackling 54,300 hectares which should be cleared to increase water yield into our dams. To date, through the GCTWF, the City contributed to clearing 4,617 hectares, 370 green job opportunities have been created (165 women and 103 youth) and 243 people have been trained. 
At a recent event held on 27 July 2022, this progress was celebrated and the highly-skilled and brave individuals who clear the hectares of alien invasive plants under difficult conditions high up in the mountains were recognised. It requires nerve and the ability to scale difficult, steep mountain terrain and remove the alien invasive plants from the high-angle slopes in the upper reaches of the catchment areas. The City also thanked The Nature Conservancy (TNC) for coordinating the programme, and the many other organisations and companies which contribute to this partnership. 
‘The City will continue to work with stakeholders and partners to make the most of opportunities to optimise the economic, social and ecological benefits of our regional water resources,’ said Councillor Zahid Badroodien, the City’s Mayoral Committee Member for Water and Sanitation.","See objectives in the above, and the SDG linkages indicated",A partnership coordinated by The Nature Conservancy,"Goal 6, Goal 8, Goal 9, Goal 11, Goal 13, Goal 15","6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.b , 8.2 , 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 9.1, 9.3, 9.a, 11.4, 11.6, 11.b, 11.c, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.b, 15.1, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5, 15.8, 15.9, 15.a","Thu, 04/01/2021 - 12:00","Tue, 04/30/2024 - 12:00","https://www.capetown.gov.za/Media-and-news/City%20invests%20R62m%20to%2…

Targeting a Final Close of USD 1 billion, CI2 reached a Second Close end 2022 with USD 855 million in commitments.
CI2 employs a mix of public and private-sector funding as well as commitments from development finance institutions (DFIs), all in mutually beneficial and complementary ways. Public-sector donors fund the development stage of the projects, which typically cannot be financed by private-sector investors. Donors also play a key role in mobilizing private-sector capital during the construction stage of the project, where risks are better understood and financial returns can be achieved.
CI2 offers financing for the entire lifecycle of a project to developers, from design to construction, and into operations through post-construction refinancing. To achieve this, CI2 comprises of three funds, each targeted at a different project stage: a development fund (goal = USD 90 million), a construction equity fund (goal = USD 1 billion) and a refinancing fund (goal = USD 1 billion). 
Within the water, sanitation, and oceans sectors, CI2 targets investments in the sub-sectors: 1) watershed management and protection, 2) bulk water supply and storage, 3) water treatment plans, 4) water transportation and pumping, 5) desalination, 6) water and sewerage utilities, 7) wastewater treatment and re-use plant, 8) waste to value and energy plant, 9) industrial wastewater treatment and re-use plant, 10) green ports, 11) green shipping and 12) coastal and marine ecosystem management and protection.","The Climate Investor 2 works on the mobilization of private sector financing for  water, sanitation and oceans finance. CI2 consists of three funds, each matching the status and bankability of a projects. Using TA and development loans, the development fund contributes to the development of water related projects to a stage where they are ready to receive investments. Then the projects move on to the construction equity fund, which can cover up to 75% of the construction financing in equity. This fund consist of three layers: one for donor capital, the second one for commercial investors and the last for institutional investors. These three layers have different conditions, each with a different risk portfolio and different type of blended finance. The last fund is the refinancing fund, this fund is still in formation, but will provide senior debt.
Climate Investor 2 aims to mobilize private sector finance for climate adaptation projects.

Our PurAID® technology as a point-like solution gives a perfect solution. No pipeline construction is needed, solves water shortage with an investment value of less than €25 per capita instead of the €500-2,500 per capita value needed for EU standard “nearly full scale” water utility infrastructure. 

PurAID® offers a sustainable and affordable solution with less than €5 annual operational cost/capita with high-quality, modern regenerable filter technology. Furthermore, it indirectly reduces the ratio of bottled water thus the quantity of plastic waste.

PurAID® is a compact technology with easy installation into an existing water treatment network or as a new purification item, where no additional pipeline construction is needed. Installation is twofold, either to an end-of-pipe or by connecting to a surface or groundwater source. 

PurAID® is entitled to secure a safe water source for rural communities with a short installation time providing healthy drinking water for the people.

We provided healthy drinking water of the citizens of Akim Wenchi (Ghana), the goal was to be able to bring safe water to the community that lacks it and do so more quickly and cost-effectively than other water projects.","local (rural) communities, water utility service providers, private investors, schools, health centres developing countries where there is no adequate water supply network, and where no sewerage system exists.",Ghana,"Africa, Global","To reach the SDG 6 goals, we need alternative approaches, financing mechanisms and solutions for safe drinking water supply and municipal liquid waste treatment. Even in Europe water utility infrastructure management and development are facing profound financing gaps. The reconstruction of the ageing water infrastructure is underfinanced and underperforming. Capital costs are not or are just partly included in tariffs, nor covered by public spending. The yearly reconstruction rate of the existing infrastructure is less than 1%-0,1%, which is presuming an unrealistic life expectancy of up to over 1.000 years. The non-refundable grant-based EU public funding for the “new accession countries” requires only the inclusion of the depreciation of the assets, (which equal to bank finance with 50 years payback period and an interest-free loan of 2% of the invested capital/year). Still, even this is not provided due to affordability limitations. Detailed and large-scale investment and asset evaluation results show that EU standard “nearly full scale” water and sanitation utility infrastructure investment/replacement costs are 1.500-7.500.-€ per capita. With the collection and distribution network fluctuating between 1.200-5.700.-€ per capita (75-80% of the total) depending on local conditions, but mainly on the size and type of the municipalities - the smaller/”rural like” the more expensive. These numbers are reflected also in the UNEP City-Level Decoupling Urban resource flows and the governance of infrastructure transition Report. It estimates that the investment required to meet the demand for urban water infrastructure (to refurbish the old and build new) is US$ 22.6 trillion. over the next 25 years for all the cities of the world. City-Level Decoupling: Urban Resource Flows and the Governance of Infrastructure Transitions (unep.org) The report suggests that by 2050 more than 6 billion people (almost 70% of the world population) will live in urban areas. Calculating US$ 22.6 trillion (US$ 22.600 Billion) for 6 Billion people we are coming to the EU standard investment value of 3.767.- USD/capita investment needs. If, in the case of the world’s richest regions full scale and inclusive water infrastructure development are unbankable, then how do we expect it to be feasible worldwide? With this alternative approach and “near-to-consumer” solutions, an investment cost for drinking water provision and liquid waste handling would be 70.- €/per capita for communities without adequate water supply or sewerage network. Drinking water for an initial investment of less than 25.-€/capita, and service of less than 5.-€/person/year, including initial capital costs. Liquid waste management, and purification for an initial investment of less than 45.- €/per capita, and service of less than 10.- €/person/year, including initial capital costs. These technologies provide structural, innovative and sustainable solutions which can also mobilize private capital to address the financial gap in the sector, supporting communities that are most left behind.","The financial resources needed to finance city-level WASH investments indicated in the UNEP City-Level Decoupling Report (22.600 Billion USD) are unrealistic to be found and invested! The alternative “near-to-consumer” solutions with an investment cost for drinking water provision and liquid waste handling would be 70.- €/per capita, and the total capital needed for 4 billion people living in less developed cities and rural areas will be only 280 Billion USD The Impact of the implementation of the alternative “near the consumer” solution will be • reduction of required investment capital by nearly 99%, • safe drinking water provision for less than 5.-€/person/year, • Liquid waste management, and purification service of less than 10.- €/person/year, • Affordable WASH services, with tariffs including initial capital costs. • return on the invested capital >> involvement of private capital. To accelerate SDG implementation in the field of drinking water purification and wastewater treatment and to avoid environmental and health problems, and without extra costs and extra work, using “near to consumer” drinking water units and the treatment of 100% liquid waste are the answers to solve the existing problem in a financially viable, sustainable and affordable way. These investments, which offer a quick, almost immediate solution, pay off in the short term and can be attractive to private investors. Private capital is thus attracted to water infrastructure investments in addition to the often extended and difficult-to-finance public projects. Moreover, these solutions contain not only the development itself but also professional training programs on retaining the local workforce and preparing them to operate the designed and built systems. To provide not only technological solutions but sustainability from a public health point of view. Surface water contamination will be eliminated, the impact on the environment as well as hazards to health will be remarkably reduced. On the basis of economic calculations and experience it can be reasonably stated that these solutions are the most cost-effective and sustainable methods for providing WHO-compliant drinking water and treating the generated 100% liquid waste, both FROM a CAPEX and OPEX point of view.","Hungarian Water Association, Pureco Group of Companies, Jospong Group of Companies, Sewerage System Ghana Limited, Ghana Water Company developing countries where there is no adequate water supply network, and where no sewerage system exists.",Goal 6,"6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.5, 6.a, 6.b",,,"Other impacts: Drinking water purification: • No Plastic waste is generated, but healthy drinking water is provided. • No Water loss, Revenue water the ROI is forecastable, a complex solution was provided without high infrastructure investment and network operation cost. • prompt solution for rural communities, settlements without network water, public institutions schools, hospitals • training for the local staff to operate and maintain the plant, and knowledge sharing.

At the same time, investments in agriculture and in nomadic and sedentary pastoralism, which together provide work for 80-90% of the population, can have a profound effect on poverty reduction and development, especially in view of the increased buying power and expanding markets in small urban growth centres. It is therefore vital to strengthen both resilience in the short term and adaptation in the long term. Women play a crucial role in this respect, particularly in natural resource management and agriculture (i.e. the food supply) in places where young men are leaving the countryside. For this reason, increasing women’s access to and control over inputs to production (land, fertiliser, water, loans and agricultural advice) and knowledge is essential.","Achieve sustainable management of soil fertility in a way that contributes to ecologically sustainable improvements in food productivity and to increased resilience of small-scale food producers (arable and/or livestock farmers) in the Sahel/West Africa and East and Central Africa.

It is also a significant carbon sink and its degradation has negative impacts on both water resources and climate change. To ensure the long-term health of water resources and mitigate climate change, sustainable management of peatland is essential. However, sustainable management of peatland faces several challenges such as deforestation, land conversion, lowering the water table, and peat burning. On the other hand, there are many opportunities for sustainable management of peatland through conservation, restoration, and innovative financing mechanisms. Data from the Global Environment Centre & Wetlands International in 2008 shows that the global peatland area is 400 million hectares, distributed in North America (45.3% of the total peatland area), Asia (36.7%), Europe (12.4%), South America (4.0%). Countries with the largest peatland areas in the world are Russia, Canada, the United States, and Indonesia. The peatland area in these countries combined can make up 60% of the total global peatland area. Meanwhile, from a tropical peatland perspective, Food and Agriculture Organization states that the area of tropical peatland is around 8% of the total peatland area in the world. 60% of it is located in Southeast Asia. Indonesia with 13.43 million hectares of tropical peatland is the country with the largest ownership of tropical peatland in the world. Peatland in Indonesia is spread across three large islands, Sumatra with 5.8 million hectares of peatland, Kalimantan with 4.5 million hectares of peatland, and Papua with 3 million hectares of peatland. The peatland in Indonesia stores around 57 gigatons of carbon, or 20 times the carbon stored in mineral soil. The carbon reserves stored in peatland will be released into the atmosphere if the peatland is dried out or converted. Peatland stores around 30% of the world's carbon. Objectives of sustainable management of peatland include: protecting and conserving peatland ecosystems and their biodiversity, maintaining the hydrological functions of peatland, such as water retention and purification, reducing greenhouse gas emissions from peatland degradation, promoting sustainable land use practices on peatland, such as sustainable agriculture and forestry, and ensuring the participation and involvement of local communities and stakeholders in peatland management. Implementation methodologies for Peatland Restoration for Sustainable Water Resources and Climate Mitigation program include: identification and mapping of peatland areas, development of management plans for peatland conservation and sustainable use, restoration of degraded peatland through rewetting and revegetation, promotion of sustainable land use practices on peatland through technical assistance and capacity building, monitoring and evaluation of peatland conservation and sustainable use efforts, and education and awareness raising on the importance of peatland and its conservation. Follow-up mechanisms for Peatland Restoration for Sustainable Water Resources and Climate Mitigation program include: regular monitoring of peatland ecosystems to assess the effectiveness of management actions, review and update of management plans as needed, regular reporting on peatland conservation and sustainable use efforts to relevant authorities and stakeholders, and implementation of adaptive management strategies to respond to changes in peatland conditions.","The Peatland Restoration for Sustainable Water Resources and Climate Mitigation program aims to restore peatland ecosystems by increasing awareness and putting pressure on decision-makers. By educating the public and decision-makers about the benefits of peatland conservation and the negative impacts of its degradation, the program aims to generate support for restoration efforts and increased pressure on decision-makers to prioritize peatland conservation. To achieve this, the program employs crowd-based monitoring which involves engaging a large group of stakeholders to gather information and hold decision-makers accountable. This is done by using social media, citizen journalism, and other digital tools to collect data and disseminate information. By involving more stakeholders, there is greater potential to generate public pressure on targeted decision-makers, leading to increased transparency and accountability in governance and promoting civic engagement and participation in decision-making processes. The program also aims to promote sustainable land use practices on peatland through technical assistance and capacity building, this will help to mitigate the negative impact of human activities on peatland ecosystems. Through the implementation of management plans for peatland conservation and sustainable use, the program will help to protect and conserve peatland ecosystems and their biodiversity, maintain the hydrological functions of peatland, such as water retention and purification and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from peatland degradation. By involving local communities and other stakeholders in peatland management decision-making, the program aims to ensure that the needs and perspectives of these groups are considered and incorporated into management decisions. This is expected to increase the effectiveness of management actions and promote greater buy-in and support for peatland conservation and sustainable use efforts. Overall, the sustainable management program for peatland is expected to have a positive impact on the health and well-being of peatland ecosystems and the people and wildlife that depend on them.",Pantau Gambut works with local partners in 9 provinces in Indonesia: 1.

Public spaces (markets, lorry stations)",Ghana,Africa,"Access to water by low-income urban dwellers in Ghana remains a challenge. Studies conducted under the IDA-sponsored Urban Water Project and the GAMA Sanitation and Water Project suggest that, in most Low-Income Urban Communities (LIUCs), less than 30% have direct piped connections. The challenge has often been the inability of LIUC residents to pay upfront for new service connections. Inevitably, LIUC residents pay far higher prices for relying on secondary water sources than those who rely on piped network systems.  Meeting the ever-increasing demands of LIUC dwellers, however, requires huge investments which requires innovative and sustainable funding approaches. Significant efforts have been made by Ghana Water Company Limited (GWCL) to bridge the inequality gap through grant support from development partners such as the World Bank, VEI/WaterWorX and UNICEF. The efforts over the last 6 years have created access to safe water for over 1,000,000 LIUC customers through 17,000 household connections. The fees paid by beneficiaries are ring-fenced into a social connection fund to provide continuous support to connect LIUC customers to GWCL’s pipelines.
With this commitment, the Utility will rely on funds previously mobilized in its social connection fund and advocate for additional innovative fund through the introduction of a surcharge on water tariffs to be allocated for water services to LIUCs. Further, the Utility will leverage its strategic relationships with development partners to obtain grant funding.
Objectives:
	Strengthen GWCL’s finance to improve access to safe water for 1,000,000 LIUC customers/consumers through the introduction of innovative financing.
	Provide subsidy-based support that creates 50,000 new water service connections in LIUCs nationwide by 2030.
Scope:
•	Communication and Advocacy
•	Fund Mobilization
•	Water Distribution Network Expansion and Household Connections
•	Post Construction Monitoring and Support
Specific activities:
1.	Develop communication and advocacy paper to reach key stakeholders – Public Utility and Regulatory Commission (PURC), Development Partners, NGOs in WASH, Water Operators Partnership (WOP)
2.	Engage key stakeholders – Example: To advocate for the surcharge to water tariff
3.	Channel funds raised into existing Social Connection Fund
4.	Extend GWCL distribution lines into selected LIUCs currently unserved by GWCL. Considerations will be made to leverage on the production capacity of GWCL in LIUCs where production capacity is high, but usage is low because of inadequate funds to do upfront investments in household connections
5.	Strengthen the demand chain through intensive promotional campaigns on safe water and available subsidy.
6.	Register prospective customers and receive payments for new service connection.
7.	Collect and analyze data using dashboards
8.	Provide subsidy and introduce new payment modalities for new service connection.
9.	Follow-up on beneficiaries of new service connections and provide education on billing, payment and water management, and encourage them to pay their bills.
10.	Conduct periodic monitoring of activities and mainstream key lessons into GWCL’s commercial and financial activities.
The initiative will be managed by the LICSD with key staff being LICSD Officers at local, regional and head office levels, Community Development Specialist, Knowledge Management Expert and Chief Manager of LICSD.","Under this commitment, the initiative will seek to offer households, schools, health centres and public spaces in low-income communities who do not have access to GWCL’s pipe network, the opportunity to access GWCL’s safe and affordable services. These beneficiaries, though are not currently served by GWCL's piped network, do obtain water for daily usage from other sources that are marked by relatively higher costs (10 to 20 times higher than the Utility’s approved rates) and excessive time spent. Alternative sources mostly used include wells, and water tanker operators.
Getting private water connections into the compounds of the unserved will generate savings in money and time that will be channeled into other needs. Money saved by using GWCL’s relatively cheaper water will improve the standard of living for low-income people as they are able to redirect their wealth to bear necessary costs in education, health and nutrition, as well as investments in their trades/businesses.
Time savings will allow school children opportunities to increase time allocations for learning and potentially improve academic performance, while working adults improve their incomes by allocating more time for their trades/businesses.
Ultimately, having access to potable water will improve the health status of people in LIUCs and enhance productivity.
It is expected that the advocacy can lead to the introduction of a surcharge on water tariffs, to be ring-fenced for water service improvements in LIUCs. A projected amount of USD 2,534,000 will be realized by 2030 (i.e. USD 611,000 from the tariff surcharge plus USD 1,923,000 from NSC fees paid by LIUC customers). If the estimated costs of connection per household is USD 200, then 12,670 new service connections can be done with funds mobilized from the surcharge and new service connection fees paid by customers/beneficiaries. Cost of connection for the remaining 37,330 will be financed by GWCL’s social connection fund.
The initiative will contribute to 5 Sustainable Development Goals including Goals 3,5, 6, 10 and 17. The initiative aligns with Goals 3 as access to potable water will lead to reduction in water-related diseases which will eventually improve the health and wellbeing of people in LIUCs. Further through the initiative, vulnerable groups like women, children, aged, and persons with special needs will all have access to water supply (Goal 5) without any form of discrimination. Ensuring that water is extended to premises of households, water is available when needed and water is of good quality and free from contamination will accelerate Goal 6. Since the initiative targets the water needs of the poor, the inequalities in service delivery will be bridged to a large extent (SDG 10). Partnering with UNICEF and KNUST to implement the initiative has a direct linkage with SDG 17 which is to strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.","UNICEF

It also worked with may universities. Although its new, the Network has a great potential which allowed it to reach out to a wide range of actors in the WASH sector. This project will establish sustainable platforms and mechanisms which coordinate the efforts of the various actors and connect them to women and youth.",State of Palestine,West Asia,"The Palestinian Women Water Network was found in 2021, its is a platform that coordinates efforts of various actors in the WASH sector to advance gender equality and social inclusion. The network is a grassroots body that works to access all women WASH practitioners in Palestine, improve their participation in decision making and improve their access to opportunities and income. In 2021 and 2022, the Network started a mapping to learn about the roles and needs of all women university students of WASH related subject, workers in WASH service providers and workers in governmental and civil society organizations. It also organized many capacity building activities for women and youth and supported their initiatives. In this project, (1) women and youth will continue the mapping and the creating of a database for the women in the WASH sector, (2) The Network will establish digital platforms for peer learning and exchange between women and youth. (3) It will also build women capacity through a feminist mentorship program, and (4) supporting women and youth led initiatives and (5) advocacy campaigns. In and by itself, the women and youth led research and action is a social justice tool. It is also a sustainable approach  that build on the women and youth assets and strengths. Besides being a grassroots body, the Network is a platform for coordinating efforts of the various actors in the WASH sector which makes it well placed to anchor active citizenry at the different levels and mobilize many actors to build the capacity of individuals and organizations at the grassroots level.
The overall objective of the project is to facilitate the participation of the women and youth water practitioners in the policy and the programming of the WASH sector as
active stakeholders.
The project has three results which are:
 Result 1: Continue the institutionalization and capacity development of the
Palestinian Women Water Practitioners Network as a grassroots body that concerns
about all the women water practitioners in Palestine and works with other
stakeholders to advance women and youth inclusion in the sector.
 Result 2: Support women and youth led learning and action following asset-based
community development approaches.
 Result 3: Unify women and youth voices and efforts to advocate for increased
transparency, accountability, and inclusion in the WASH sector.","through implementing out activities and achieving our outcomes we interlink with the SDG goals #5 & #6
The first result is to continue to institutionalize the Palestinian Women Water Practitioners Network, through (1) registering the network or finding a democratic hosting mechanism, (2) grow the Networks general assembly and (3) promote the Network including through social media. As a grassroots body that concerns about  women and youth WASH practitioners and connects them to the various actors in the sector, the Network is well positioned to advocate for improved governance and human rights and inclusion.
The second result is to support women and youth led actions to influence the sector’s policy and programming using a community led development methods, including (1) a youth and women led peer learning trajectory where the youth define the learning topics and the learning methods, conduct research to find solutions, and develop initiatives to support governance and livelihoods through improved governance and technical innovation, (2) continue to build a database for all of the Palestinian Women Water Practitioners and (3) establish digital platforms for peer learning among women and youth WASH practitioners and to unify their voices and advocacy efforts and (4) establish a program for feminist mentorship for women and youth at the different levels. This peer learning, women and youth led feminist approach sustainable and it
strengthens the peers networking which is important to strengthen joint work for advancing human rights and governance.
The third result is unifying the voices of women and youth for joint advocacy for improve transparency, accountability and governance through (1) establishing a women and youth led watchdog for monitoring gender equality, social inclusion and good governance in the WASH sector, (2) conduct a participatory research on the potential role of the men water practitioners in advancing gender equality and social inclusion and (3) a youth and women led advocacy campaign that is based on youth priorities.","The Network is currently hosted by the Palestinian Hydrology Group and led by a Steering Committee that is considered to be our main partners which are: the Palestinian Water Authority, the Water Sector Regulatory Council, the Environment Quality Authority, Birzeit  University, ARIJ, the Palestinian Environmental NGOs Network, the Palestinian Agricultural Relief Committees, the Women’s Affairs Technical Committee, the Rural Women Development Society, the Women Affairs Center and individual water practitioners.

            Full Expansion of Framework across all 10 identified Hydrologic Regions in the Canadian Columbia Basin with data publicly available",Human communities and the natural ecosystems that we and all other species rely on.,Canada,North America,"Increased water monitoring and research will enable deeper understanding of climate impacts, so communities and industry can better prepare for change.

The goal of the Columbia Basin Water Monitoring Framework is to establish a unified monitoring network that reflects local community priorities and concerns within a scientific water balance approach for the Canadian Columbia Basin. 

Integral to the methodology developed uniquely for the Columbia Basin, where glacier melt has passed peak flow, is the selection of monitoring sites using a Priority Monitoring Matrix, which is developed to collate scientific and community priorities, identify synergies, and select sites which will meet multiple objectives, resulting in a nested, cost-effective approach to monitoring.

Watersheds are stratified into groups that tend to respond similarly to climate impacts. A GIS data gap analysis will inventory the number and types of watersheds that are already being monitored. Sites are selected to ensure that each watershed grouping is represented in the expanded monitoring network. 

Local priorities for expanded monitoring are identified through consultation with First Nations and Local Reference Groups created for each Area of Interest, composed of water stewardship groups; community members; First Nations; industry/commercial water users; and local, regional, and provincial governments. 

Scientific needs and community priorities are  considered during the site selection process. Sites are identified for streamflow; groundwater, lake and wetland levels; water quality; and biomonitoring using the federal Canadian Aquatic Biomonitoring protocols, and an advanced eDNA metabarcoding technology. Data is collected using standardized and third-party protocols to ensure that it can be used for analysis, research and decision making. 

This methodology was implemented in three pilot areas of the Canadian Columbia Basin in 2022. In 2023, monitoring will be expanding into new areas and preliminary data from the pilot project will be made publicly available.","An expanded water monitoring network designed to provide the data required to measure a region’s water balance is a strong foundation for responding to key environmental water concerns associated with the climate crisis. 

The data collected through this project can be used by community members, researchers, the private sector, all levels of government and decision makers. This comprehensive, paradigm-shifting approach to watershed management will support local, regional and national efforts to increase climate adaptation options via necessary future water budgets — and support the longer term viability of natural ecosystems and ecosystem services. This nexus of social science, water science and Indigenous knowledge to enhance watershed security and adaptation can serve as a template for other river basins.

            In our online app https://tinyurl.com/2frzek9r we will set up the sheet to match the number of wells that we are funded to install by the instructions on the sheet. It is anticipated that we will not be funded to install a sufficient number of wells to resolve the water problem in the first few years. We will therefor estimate that we will be funded to install less than enough wells to supply water for a population of 50,000 people. We will assume that 50 people will share each well and that 1000 wells will be required. The spreadsheet indicates that such a program will result in a cost of 12.60 dollars per person. The cost would be based upon all the training expense being covered by funding from OMW. That would include the training and funding of equipment for 10 crews of 3 persons each. 

Alternatively, if we receive sufficient funding we can complete any number of wells in this period of time as outlined by our online app.

            We assume that we may or may not receive sufficient funding to complete enough wells to supply water for all 2.2 billion people who are without access to clean water. However, if we are funded, we will complete training of enough persons to furnish clean water for all the people of the world. However, the caveat is that we will complete this task by drilling as per our on plan that requires wells that will furnish enough clean water for each well to furnish water for the maximum number of persons that the well will supply according to our online app. That would mean that some people would have access on site and others would have to travel to obtain water. ","We are a training and educational organization. We have trained over 500 drillers and have drilled over 601 training wells. We have not required partners other than those we list as clients that wish to receive training. We have clients that we train and then they train others without an obligation to One Million Wells. Our invention is applicable globally. Our success depends on acquiring sufficient funding to furnish water to all those that are in need. 

Our number of beneficiaries is directly proportional to the funding we require based upon our estimates shown in our app that accompanies our submission. ( https://tinyurl.com/2frzek9r ) One may take the funding that one wishes to supply and keep that in mind while adding into the spreadsheet the number of persons to benefit and the expected number of persons using each well. For example, if we enter 100,000 people in green box 1 and 150 persons sharing each well in green box 2 and 150 as the number of wells each crew can drill a year. Then in green box 4, we enter 1 year with the overhead in green box 5 (per well) we will have an answer for the example. The cost per person will be 4.04 USD and 404,444 USD of total cost. The per well cost will be 606.67 USD.  We also can see that there will be 667 wells required and only 4 drilling rigs and crews.
One can enter hundreds of millions of beneficiaries or billions of beneficiaries in the web based form.
Therefore, our method of drilling is global in scale and all it requires is funding. The number of beneficiaries is directly related to the funding and therefore unlimited.","Brazil, Ethiopia, Guatemala, Honduras, India, Kenya, Malawi, Mexico, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe",Global,"Our objective is to work our ""game changing"" plan to furnish water to all 2.2 billion people currently without sufficient clean water. We have a working plan that is possible for an exponentially growing method of furnishing water. To accomplish the plan, we will become the primary training platform for our game changing method of drilling boreholes, also called water wells. Our plan to furnish water is a ""self exponentially growing"" plan. Our proven method of training is simple. Our trainers train client drillers in the classroom and with field instruction. The plan calls for each student installing 3 complete wells. We require all of our client trainees to train others just as they have been trained. We help those who are trained to drill by furnishing, at no cost, the equipment to drill. We suggest that each of our trained crews train an additional 10 crews within a year for 2 years without our direct interference. We license our patent and name to those who fulfill our training objectives. At this time there is a minimal fee or no fee for those we train and that train others. Our drilling invention won the Patents for Humanity Award for its ability to drill larger diameter boreholes to a greater depth than any other method and to do so at a lower cost. The reason the invention is game changing is because it can drill large diameter boreholes using reverse flow technology. Reverse flow technology is capable of drilling larger diameter boreholes because the flow of the drill fluid is up the drill stem rather than down the drill stem. This makes it possible to drill larger diameter boreholes because the velocity of the drilling fluid is higher than in other methods of drilling. The drill has been tested using both steel and PVC drill stem. The maximum drilling depth using steel drill stem is more than 1000 ft. The drill also uses PVC drill stem, and the maximum depth would be in excess of 200 ft. The drill can be operated manually or mechanically with an engine driven drive. It may be used with human power or engine power. Another reason that the drill is a game changer is that it is exceptionally suited for use in alluvial plains and is ideal for agricultural irrigation. The invention has opened up greater possibilities for expanded drilling programs. For example, the cost of boreholes using the drill is so low that it makes it economically feasible to install injection wells in areas where recharge is currently not in use. The invention is a basic tool that makes possible our plan for ""water neighborhoods"" https://rb.gy/skhiuo  that result in a circular water program. The drill installs irrigation wells for farmers, the excess water is used for drinking. Rainwater and excess farm water is directed to infiltration and detention ponds and then reinjected into the aquifer. This circular path would not be possible without a low-cost method of drilling.","This is a game changing method of drilling for water that has been field proven and tested. The reason it is game changing is because it is different in all respects from other methods of drilling. The One Million Wells method is actually a tool that replaces all other hand drilling methods and most other power-driven methods. That is because the OMW method is actually a method of removing cuttings and not a single method of drilling. The OMW method with PVC drill stem can be used to replace driving, direct circulation, jetting, sludging, auguring and hand digging of water wells. With steel drill stem it can replace percussion, direct circulation and hand as well as engine powered drilling. Why is the OMW method game changing? Because the OMW drilling method is all-inclusive in its drilling methods, it costs less to own and operate than other tools. Our records from the drilling of more than 584 wells indicates that it is possible to drill water wells that can furnish water for the 2.2 billion people in need for as little as 50 cents per person for a completed well, plus the cost of the pump. And that would be for a well that is designed to last 20 years. The OMW drill is the only manual drill that a person would need to drill in any suitable location in the world. The OMW drill does not propose to remove other tools from the market. It has become clear that the existing tools, both mechanical and manual, have not been able to resolve the water shortage problem. The intent of the OMW drill is to supplement the existing tools. Recent papers indicate that in some areas of the world, 60 percent of boreholes have failed. UN documents have recently indicated that by some metrics, there are less than 800 million without water. Using other metrics, there are 2.2 billion people without water of sufficient quality. Using either metric, the OMW drill can resolve the water shortage problem. If the existing drilling tools can just maintain their current progress, and OMW can enter the market, then the odds of resolving the problem are greatly enhanced. The OMW tool is game changing because it is faster and cheaper to use than other tools. Our current record indicates that we are averaging 2.44 days to drill an 8 inch diameter water well less than 100 ft deep. Our records show that between 200 and 400 liters per minute are pumped by our wells. When calculations are made using our spreadsheets, the volume of water that is pumped is sufficient to furnish water for more than 1400 people. Our calculations indicate that the cost per person is less than 50 cents. Our OMW drill can resolve the water problem because it is capable of exponentially increasing its use and its use is the least expensive method of furnishing high quality water.","Institute for Transformative Technologies : https://bit.ly/400r5FA,    2nd Milk, Jason Carney  jason@2ndmilk.org,   Educate Uganda, Karen Van Dyke, karen@educateuganda.org,    Hava Ministries , Shane Boyett info@ahavaministries.org, Flint Global , Laura Hickman, laurahickman@flintglobal.org,  VRECU, Jaime@healthedglobal.com   Fiorucci, Jamie,   Olemcagrotech, Thomas Fuller,  thomas.fuller@olmecagro-tech.org,  One Acre Fund, Ben Mitchell   ben.mitchell@oneacrefund.org, The Brazil Project,  Richard OK   RIchard@thebrazilproject.org, Water DIY,  Armand Lanier,  Armand Lanier , I58 Guatemala,   Harvey Falconer,  harvey.falconer@vidareal.tv, Tomus Brazil, David Peixoto         david@tomus.com.br, Get - Sa,   John Kalalajohn, kalala.ngeleka@get-sa.co.za,  Drops of Grace, Aaron lancaster, aaronl@dropsofgrace.org

This link https://tinyurl.com/2k3qsxab is to our online Reverse Annular Velocity (RAV) calculator. This app works on smartphones, laptops and computers and is invaluable to those in the field or office. The app can give information as to the reverse annular velocity that a particular drill and air compressor setup can provide. By properly matching the RAV to the soil conditions on site it enables the drilling crew to match the RAV to the site conditions. For example, a high RAV is required for rock and clay and a smaller RAV is required for sand and soft soils. This app allows the driller to use the right RAV for each condition. This app is available online to any driller.

This paper illuminates the importance of proper groundwater recharge. The paper primarily deals with alluvial materials in deltas near coastlines. We plan to resolve those recharge issues by injecting water from the rivers (see Rivers of the World below) through the use of infiltration and sedimentation ponds. https://1drv.ms/v/s!AglCyzMf1rkIgdBo5wj-yCrkllDijQ?e=pqKQzp

Brazil (CGEE), Global Action Plan, Togo, Tunisia, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe",Africa,"Delivery of water investments across Africa is below target to meet the continent’s growing needs. The World Banks estimates that at least US$30 billion/year needs to be invested to meet the SDG 6 target on water and sanitation. Currently, only US$10-US$19 billion is invested each year.  

The AIP-Water Investment Scorecard was developed through the African Union Development Agency-NEPAD’s Continental Africa Water Investment Programme (AIP), which aims to close the water investments gap by mobilising at least US$30 billion/year by 2030.  

The AIP-PIDA Water Investment Scorecard will enhance mutual accountability for results in the mobilisation of water investments by focusing on the use of the Scorecard accountability and peer review mechanisms at continental, regional, national, sub-national, and community levels.  

The Scorecard will assist AUDA-NEPAD to sustain political and leadership commitment, and support countries to track progress, set benchmarks, identify bottlenecks, and take action to meet the investment needs for PIDA water projects and achievement of SDG 6 on water and sanitation. 

Adopted by AUDA-NEPAD, the Scorecard will accompany the implementation of PIDA-PAP 2 water projects being implemented during 2021-2030 and become part of the modus operandi of the AUDA-NEPAD delivery model. 

The Scorecard’s framework has three key pillars that were identified as being critical for accelerating water investments. Under each pillar are key result areas that will serve in monitoring and tracking investments gaps. The three pillars are as follows:  

1. Enabling Environment for Water Investments: An enabling environment with strong, forward looking, and inclusive governance systems is an essential driving force for investment in the water and sanitation sectors.  

2. Mobilising Water Investments and Financing: Existing national, private, and donor investments in key sectors are essential for crowding in further long-term investment in the sector. This pillar will capture existing efforts for investment mobilisation in order to ensure the viability of investments in the sector. 

3. Enhancing Investment Performance and Sustainability: This pillar brings together key domains impacting water investment sustainability, performance, and efficiency. 

The AIP-PIDA Water Investment Scorecard has identified indicators that will be tracked in order to highlight where the bottlenecks and gaps are under each of the framework pillars. Each country will monitor and track the indicators, which will be displayed on a Scorecard, highlighting areas where support is needed to address the gaps.  

The Scorecard maintains a level of independence, making use of reliable data sources, to ensure that it remains a trusted tool for decision makers and investors to support the acceleration of water investments in Africa. Indicators should be practical and measurable, taking into consideration context and capacities of the Member States. Scorecard indicators have a baseline which can be used to attribute causal inference over time.","Data collection on the Scorecard began in 2022 and by the start of 2023, 10 pilot Scorecards had been prepared. The pilot countries are Benin, CAR​, Cameroon​, Malawi, Kenya, Tanzania, Tunisia, Togo, Uganda, and Zambia). Scorecards will eventually be prepared for all 55 AU Member States, and thereports and the progress to address the gaps will be reported bi-annually to AU Heads of States to increase the understanding of the issues impeding water investments.  

The long-term impact of the Scorecard will be responding to the gaps that have been identified, and addressing them. This will be done through the development of response strategies. The implementation of the response strategies will be spearheaded by countries, supported by partners based on their area of expertise and interest. The partners make up the AIP Expert Advisory Group – over 40 specialists in water-related areas.  

The Scorecard is expected to have the following impact:  

1. Enhance accountability for results in mobilisation of water investments, mobilise political, and leadership commitment,  

2. Support countries to track progress, identify bottlenecks, and take action to meet the investment needs for achievement of SDG 6 on water and sanitation,  

3. Set benchmarks to track country progress and offer a cross-country learning on water investment climate readiness,  

4. Serve as a tool to engage with public and private investors on financing water infrastructure that will contribute to development, and

The World Bank estimates that at least US$30 billion/year needs to be invested to meet the SDG 6 target on water and sanitation. Currently, only US$10-US$19 billion is invested each year. There is a need for increased investments at domestic level, international level, and by private sector investors to close the US$11-20 billion/year gap.    

The International High-Level Panel on Water Investments for Africa was formally launched on 25 March 2022, during the 9th World Water Forum in Dakar by H.E. Macky Sall, President of the Republic of Senegal with the goal of driving high-level political support and international engagement to narrow the water investment gap. The Panel will enhance efforts to meet the socio-economic needs of the continent, SDG water related targets, and address the twin challenge of climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic. 

The Panel is co-chaired by H.E. Macky Sall, President of the Republic of Senegal; H.E. Hage Geingob, President of Republic of Namibia; and H.E. Mark Rutte, Prime Minister of the Netherlands. H.E. Jakaya Kikwete, Former President of the United Republic of Tanzania, is the Panel’s alternate co-chair. An additional 13 members – including Heads of State and leaders of global developmental organisations – sit on the Panel.   

The Panel will develop actionable pathways for countries to mobilise at least USD 30 billion annually until 2030, for implementing the Continental Africa Water Investment Programme (AIP) and to close the water investment gap in Africa. The AIP was adopted by African Heads of State during the African Union Ordinary Summit in February 2021 to accelerate delivery of water investments on the continent and meet SDG 6 water related targets. The Panel’s work will be sustained through the AIP Water Investment Scorecard that has been initiated to track progress in attracting water investments, identifying bottlenecks, and enhancing mutual accountability and commitment for action. 

The Panel will develop a High-Level Report and Investment Plan that will be launched during the 2023 UN Conference. The High-Level Report and related analysis will consider previous high-level commitments, recommendations, and initiatives to facilitate coordinated efforts to accelerate implementation at the pace required to meet SDG water related targets, narrow the water investments gap, and address the Covid-climate emergency economic recovery efforts. These include the Addis Ababa Action Agenda that provides a new global framework for financing sustainable development by aligning all financing flows and policies with economic, social, and environmental priorities; the UN SDG 6 Global Accelerator Framework; the Africa Water Vision; the AU Agenda 2063; and others.","The Panel’s High-Level Report and Investment Action Plan will identify key lessons from the global pandemic related to water security and climate change and will recommend ways in which countries can  narrow the water investment gap, increase efficiency, and accelerate progress on SDG water related targets to support the African Union Agenda 2063. 

The Panel will promote development and implementation of regional and national climate resilience and inclusive water investment programmes as a means to address the bottlenecks that constrain water investments and progress, with particular attention to countries that are lagging and need more attention. During 2022, Zambia became the first country to develop and launch a national water investment programme with the support of the Panel. The Zambia Water Investment Programme will leverage US$5.75 billion for water security investments and create approximately 200,000 formal jobs in Zambia by 2030. The Gambia has committed to working with the Panel in 2023 to develop a national water investment programme, and talks are underway with number of other countries.  

Increased water investments result in improved economic and job opportunities, cooperation and peace, climate resilience among vulnerable communities, reduced incidences of communicable diseases, the protection of fragile ecosystems, as well as the reduction in migration and the displacement of communities.  

250 million African people stand to benefit from resilient water investments and economic opportunities.

These include sovereign wealth funds, guarantees, commercial finance, institutional investors and private equity investors, foundations, value-based impact investment, and climate finance.

Delivery of water investments across Africa is below target to meet the continent’s growing needs. The World Bank estimates that at least US$30 billion/year needs to be invested to meet the SDG 6 target on water and sanitation. Currently, only US$10-US$19 billion is invested each year. 

Currently the subject of a feasibility study, the Facility will complement and leverage existing project preparation facilities for water and climate to mobilise investments for climate resilient development. The scope of investments targeted by the Blended Investment Facility is defined as investments across the entire water sector value chain in Africa, with suitable financing instruments developed for each investment category.

The scope of the fund will include support to the three pillars identified as essential to close the water investment gap by the AIP Water Investment Scorecard: 
•	Strengthening the enabling environment for water investments
•	Track and mobilise finance and investments
•	Enhancing investment performance and sustainability

The Blended Investment Facility needs to mobilise additional investments by doubling the current rate of annual investments. The specific objectives are to:
•	Promote the financing of priority water investment projects to potential financiers across a broad spectrum including all potential public and private financing sources 
•	Broker strategic linkages between project owners and suitable financiers 
•	Provide ongoing technical assistance in investment development and facilitate resource mobilization across project preparation cycles 

The Blended Investment facility will specifically target the private sector as a major source of investments, and mobilise and blend public-private finance to close the water investment gap. The Fund will leverage new and existing water and climate resilience-related investments at a national, regional, continental, and international level, to mobilise private and commercial capital.

At least US$30 billion/year needs to be invested to meet SDG 6 target on water and sanitation. Currently, only US$10-US$19 billion is invested annually. The AIP aims to close the water investments gap of US$11-US$20 billion/year by mobilising at least US$30 billion/year by 2030.

Inadequate investments flows into new and ongoing transboundary or regional integrated project pipelines are subject to governance, policy & institutional capacity bottlenecks. This disrupts project preparation & management cycle, stifles investor confidence and access to finance, and slows down the implementation of transboundary projects.
The AIP was adopted by the Assembly of the African Union Heads of State and Government as part of Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa – Priority Action Plan 2 (PIDA-PAP 2) in 2021. The goal is to support an enabling environment for accelerated planning, preparation and financing of transboundary and regional water-health-energy–food nexus projects that foster the integrated corridor approach for regional infrastructure development. The objective is to catalyse investments flows into integrated regional and transboundary water-health-energy-food nexus projects that promote inclusivity and regional economic integration.

Through a range of support programmes and interventions, the AIP aims to: 

1.	Mobilise high-level political commitment and leadership on water investments
The International High-Level Panel on Water Investments for Africa was established in 2022, comprising current and former Heads of State and global leaders. The Panel will develop actionable pathways for countries to mobilise US$30bn annually by 2030, for implementing the AIP. 

2.	Develop and implement the AIP-PIDA Water Investment Scorecard to enhance mutual accountability, transparency and efficiency of water finance and investments
The AIP-PIDA Water Investment Scorecard supports countries to track progress, set benchmarks, identify bottlenecks, and take action to meet Africa’s water investment needs. The Scorecard was adopted by the African Union Development Agency-NEPAD as part of the Programme for Infrastructure Development in Africa in February 2022. 

3.	Develop capacity to formulate regional and national water investment programmes to close the water investment gap
Many African countries are extremely vulnerable to climate variability and climate change; and are further faced with weak institutional capacities, water infrastructure, and information systems to support water management. Programmes supported by the AIP will address these gaps, informed by insights from the AIP-PIDA Water Investment Scorecard.

4.	Assess the need for the AIP International Blended Investment Mechanism to leverage public-private finance
The AIP will assess the need for an International Blended Investment Mechanism to support countries to leverage ODA and grant finance to de-risk priority water investments using a variety of innovative financial instruments and sources. These include sovereign wealth funds, guarantees, commercial finance, institutional investors and private equity investors, foundations, value-based impact investment, and climate finance.

5.	Promote gender equality and empowerment of women and girls in water investments
The AIP will develop tools to assist governments to address systemic inequalities in decision-making, planning, and implementation of investments, by fostering a transformative approach in agencies, structures, and social relations.","The AIP aims to close Africa’s water investment gap of US$11-US$20 billion/year by mobilising at least US$30 billion/year by 2030 and contribute to SDG 6 targets and all other related SDGs. The outcomes of the AIP demonstrate the interlinked and interdependent nature of water investments on social and economic outcomes.
Increased water investments result in improved economic and job opportunities, cooperation and peace, climate resilience among vulnerable communities, reduced incidences of communicable diseases, the protection of fragile ecosystems, as well as the reduction in migration and the displacement of communities. 
250 million African people stand to benefit from resilient water investments and economic opportunities. Closing Africa’s water investment gap can create 4 million indirect jobs for vulnerable, poor youth and women as well as 1 million direct jobs through climate resilient water and sustainable sanitation
By 2030, the AIP aims to: 

1.	Establish and operationalise the International High-Level Panel on Water Investments for Africa. The Panel was formally inaugurated during COP27 in November 2022. 

2.	Assess the need for AIP International Blended Investment Mechanism. The assessment process led by UNDP commenced in January 2023. 

3.	Develop and operationalise the AIP-PIDA Water Investment Scorecard. The Scorecard was adopted by the African Union Development Agency in 2022, its framework developed through a lengthy consultative process and 10 pilot scorecard published at the start of 2023. 
4.	Develop capacity for regional, basin and country water investment programmes. With AIP support, two countries – Zambia and Zanzibar – launched national water investment programmes during 2022. 
5.	Develop and operationalise the African Union Governance Framework and Job Creation Toolkit for Water-Energy-Food-Ecosystem Nexus investments
6.	Incorporate gender equality and empowerment of women and girls in water investments
7.	Prepare and implement bankable climate resilient transboundary water investments 
8.	Strengthen the business cases for the role of water in the economy and accelerate the delivery of climate-resilient water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) investments.","African Governments, African Union Development Agency-NEPAD (AUDA-NEPAD), African Development Bank (AfDB), African Ministers Council on Water (AMCOW), Regional Economic Communities (RECs) in Africa, River Basin Organisations (RBOs) in Africa, Regional Water Partnerships, Country Water Partnerships, UNDP, UNICEF, Global Water Partnership Africa, Development Bank Southern Africa, World Bank, World Meteorological Organization, World Health Organization, Food & Agriculture Organization, United Nations Environment Programme, Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, United Nations Industrial Development Organization, Global Center on Adaptation, Stockholm International Water Institute, International Union for Conservation of Nature, International Water Management Institute, Sanitation and Water for All, Alliance for Global Water Adaptation, WaterAid, C40 Cities, Cap-Net, Care International, Austrian Development Agency, Swiss Agency for Development, SIDA, SADC Regional Fund for Water Infrastructure and Basic Sanitation","Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 8, Goal 13, Goal 16, Goal 17","5.5, 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b","Wed, 04/01/2020 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2030 - 12:00","https://aipwater.org/approach/

Involved partners will commit themselves to these action perspectives and will follow-up on this after the conference.

With respect to prioritization of water (re-)allocation , it will for instance be important to consider the societal value of water used by agriculture for food production when assessing the potential trade-offs in water-reallocations between diverse water users. So not only the value of water for the farmer in terms of higher production, but also the value of water for food security and stability. The value of water for staple crops is for instance low in terms of crop production, but high in terms of food security. The current situation shows the need to reassess the socio-economic value of water for food, in terms of food security for stability in vulnerable regions. This is a game changer.","The chapter and water and food will show the interlinkages between SDG 2 (food) and SDG 6 (water) and the importance (and challenges) to address them jointly.
The design of Food System Pathways and National Water Roadmaps requires coordinated action as they are linked.
National water and food security are important in times of instability. 
The idea of food trade to mitigate water scarcity is for instance appealing, but geopolitical interests may dominate water concerns.

The event will provide a platform for sharing experiences, knowledge, and best practises in dealing with these natural hazards and exploring ways to increase resilience and reduce vulnerability.

The specific issues and themes that will be addressed include

•	Understanding the causes and impacts of drought and floods and their relationship with climate change.
•	Identifying and assessing the risks of drought and floods at different scales
•	Developing early warning systems and emergency response plans
•	Enhancing Water Management and conservation strategies

Drought occurs when there is not enough water for people, plants, and animals. Heavy rain or dam failure can cause flooding. Drought and floods can destroy crops, properties, and lives. Flash floods can be the result of strong rain after a drought. Climate change worsens droughts and floods. Droughts and floods are considered natural hazards that can have a significant impact on the achievement of SDG 6, which is to ensure the availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Droughts can lead to water scarcity and reduce access to clean drinking water, while floods can contaminate water sources and damage infrastructure. Effective management of droughts and floods is therefore crucial in achieving SDG 6, as well as in reducing the negative impacts of these hazards on other SDGs, such as health and food security. The project format Knowledge Experience at Sea, www.iaamonline.org/knowledge-experience-at-sea  would communicate spatial boundaries (geographical, cultural, social), scientific boundaries (science, engineering, and technology), as well as climate change due to industrialisation, pollution, loss of biodiversity, through the perspective of a continents. 
 The impact of these side events of a water conference would include a variety of activities and discussions related to the management and conservation of water resources. This event will include the following agenda:
Panel Discussion: Response to drought and floods, resilience and mitigation.
Climate change, drought, and floods will be covered along with current difficulties and solutions. It may also discuss climate resilience research and best practises and provide case studies of successful projects and efforts. Penalist discussions would also emphasise the importance of government, private industry, and public society working together to combat drought and floods. Climate-neutral R&D and green technologies will be discussed in line with its accumulative sustainable development agenda. The IAAM is making international efforts with Materials Science, Engineering, and Technology across the spheres of academia and industry to potentially address the challenges of sustainability of materials and water systems for a green world.

            focus on educating communities about water and sanitation management.",Vulnerable communities in the North West region of Cameroon,Cameroon,Africa,"Problem Statement:
Access to safe, clean water and sanitation is an increasingly urgent global issue requiring immediate attention. Despite significant advances in human development and global infrastructure, more than 2 billion people do not have access to safely managed water and sanitation. This lack of access is particularly acute in developing countries, where inadequate infrastructure and a lack of resources can drastically impede efforts to ensure adequate supply and management of both water and sanitation.
Analysis:
The main cause of this problem is the disruption of water and sanitation infrastructure caused by insufficient funding and resources for maintenance and improvement. This lack of access to clean water and sanitation often results in poor health outcomes as a result of drinking contaminated water, as well as increased risk of disease from inadequate sanitation. In addition, many communities around the world are already facing acute water stress, due to steadily increasing demand and insufficient supply. This increased demand has led to the depletion of local water sources, often forcing people to rely on private vendors or unreliable sources of potentially polluted water.
Furthermore, access to water and sanitation can be further impeded by economic, political and geographical factors. Wealthier parts of the population are often able to purchase larger amounts of water or access more reliable sources, while poorer areas may be left with inadequate supply. Other challenges include political and economic instability, areas with difficult terrain, or a lack of public awareness of the importance of clean water and sanitation. 
Finally, a lack of investment in water and sanitation infrastructure has exacerbated the existing challenges and risks associated with access to water and sanitation, often due to a lack of political interest in these issues. As a result, existing infrastructure may be underutilized or not used at all, leading to an inability to meet current or future needs for water and sanitation. 
Given the complexity of these issues, there is a need for sustainable and integrated approaches to ensure the availability and management of water and sanitation for all. Such an approach must account for the challenges outlined above, as well as the need for investment in both infrastructure and education. The goal is to ensure clean and safe water and sanitation for all, while promoting sustainable development.
Given these challenges, Diomo Inc. needs to focus its attention on water and sanitation availability and sustainability so that it can better meet the needs of all people, both in developing and developed countries. In particular, it needs to focus on providing access to clean, safe, and reliable water and sanitation services to those without it, developing water and sanitation infrastructure in areas where it is lacking, and creating equitable access to water and sanitation services. To do this, it must work to identify existing water and sanitation challenges and potential solutions, establish partnerships and collaborations with international organizations and governments, provide support for funding and incentives for water and sanitation improvement initiatives, and focus on educating communities about water and sanitation management.","Given the complexity of these issues, there is a need for sustainable and integrated approaches to ensure the availability and management of water and sanitation for all.

The most crucial challenge is keeping water issues at the core of all government policymaking and on top of imperatives to align competing political agendas. To overcome the challenges, APWF aims to enhance political leaders' awareness and their political will to ensure that water issues not be treated as a stand-alone problem. Rather, they shall have the capacity to design and implement policies effectively that drive systemic change and address the nexus of water, food, energy, climate change and ecosystems. Capacity building is a crucial game changer. Hence. APWF has demonstrated its track-record to convene political leadership and build up capacity to maintain and enhance their committed leadership through:

1) The Asia-Pacific Water Summits - for political leaders to promote political engagement and endorsements through political dialogue and declarations to share expected benefits, to put water on top of the political agenda remind the value of water.

2) Intergovernmental coordination - as a platform between the national governments and key stakeholders to improve intergovernmental coordination of the nexus with the provision of tailored capacity development opportunities.

APWF works collaboratively with a wide variety of water-related organizations in the region to build capacity and enhance cooperation, while boosting investment at the regional level and beyond. The APWF has provided countries and organizations in Asia and the Pacific with a common platform and voice to accelerate the process of effective integration of water resources management into the socio-economic development process.

The APWF has established a well-coordinated network of its member organizations that is founded upon their willingness to meet the needs of decision-makers, policy-makers, and practitioners and identify solutions for water security for sustainable development. The width of the expert knowledge, experience, and lessons of the members are capitalized upon to address a range of water issues derived from the diversity of Asia and the Pacific and to make it water secure.","1) Cross-region, cross-discipline and cross-sector partnership - as a platform for multi-stakeholders to work together beyond disciplines and sectors among different levels while taking an end-to-end approach to strengthening the science-policy-society interface.

2) Intellectual knowledge and database - as a platform to foster ""Facilitators,"" catalytic beings who can lead the way toward resolving problems by providing professional advice on-site using a broad range of scientific and indigenous knowledge to address water for climate resilience and the environment.

3) Cross-generation talents development - as a platform for youth to connect and promote their actions to encourage meaningful youth engagement with political leaders and international and regional experts and practitioners, providing capacity development opportunities if necessary.

4) And connecting with global community - as a platform to showcase best practices in Asia and the Pacific for the international community.","APWF Governing Council, Asian Development Bank, UNESCAP, FAO, UNESCO, UN-HABITAT, EC-IFAS, Freshwater Action Partnership for South Asia, Global Water Institute UNSW, Global Water Partnership, GWP China, GWP CACENA, GWP South Asia, GWP Southeast Asia, ICHARM, ICIMOD, IUCN Asia, IWMI, International WaterCentre, Japan Sanitation Consortium, Japan Water Forum, NARBO/Japan Water Agency, Korea Water Forum, Secretariat of Pacific Community, Singapore PUB, World Toilet Organization, WaterEd Australia, Alliance for Water Stewardship Asia-Pacific, Water Integrity Network","Goal 2, Goal 6, Goal 9, Goal 11, Goal 13, Goal 15, Goal 17","2.4 , 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 9.1, 11.5, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 15.1, 15.3, 15.4, 17.5, 17.6, 17.9",,,"Kumamoto Declaration - https://apwf.org/apwf_wp/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Kumamoto-Declaration.pdf

            To promote different global actions and projects under the “Ocean Literacy With All Programme”, an endorsed UN Ocean Decade action coordinated by IOC-UNESCO, encouraging synergies between Water Literacy (SDG6) and Ocean Literacy (SDG14)","The beneficiaries will be not just the partner organizations, but also the audiences we all work with through our Brazilian or International projects, since many of these organizations work in different continents, as IOC-UNESCO or the UN Global Compact (Acqua Mater is also a signatory). Depending on the project we're developing together (Acqua Mater with one or more of the organizations mentioned above, or even others), the target audience varies widely, from young children to adults, considering Diversion, Equity, Inclusion (DEI). It's important to mention that human beings will always benefit from these projects, since they depend on safe water to drink and on sanitation for their well-being, but also on a healthy and sustainable ocean to thrive in all levels, and to leave a living country for their descendants.","Angola, Brazil, Cabo Verde, Cameroon, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, European Commission, Ireland, Italy, Lebanon, Monaco, Netherlands, Norway, Panama, Portugal, Ibero-American Network of Life Cycle Assesment, United States of America",Global,"Objectives: In the (full version of the) title of this Institutional Voluntary Commitment, that results from the gap of collaboration Acqua Mater sees between those working with “Water & Sanitation” and the “Ocean”, we have tried to summarize the main objectives of this initiative: “to promote more synergies and dialogues between SDG 6 and SDG 14 to accelerate the 2030 agenda by encouraging international, intergenerational and cross-sectoral cooperation and partnerships among individuals and collectives that place the Water and the Ocean in the center of their research and business”. We use to say that each drop of water on land comes from the ocean and will go back there one day, as the hydrological cycle shows us. Ancient traditions, philosophies and mythologies from all over the world use the same symbols and representations for the Water and the Ocean. Nevertheless, we separate fresh and salty waters as if they were not integrated in the same interconnected aquatic ecosystem that traverses our planet as the blood traverses our veins. Even if we need to separate SDG6 and SDG14 to find focused solutions for their targets, we cannot lose the “eagle view”: we need to think global to act local. Everybody knows: no water, no life. It’s not by chance that different articles indicate interlinkages between SDG6 and all the other SDGs, or between SDG14 and all the other SDGs too. They’re both the starting point to tackle all the challenges humankind have been facing, as the climate crisis. That’s why we need to create more synergies between both SDGs to accelerate the 2030 Agenda. The pandemic taught us that cooperation is key to overcome any obstacle, that differences become complementary allies to find effective solutions to common problems we face: intergenerational, international and cross-sector partnerships are pivotal to move forward. The main implementation methodologies Acqua Mater’s projects will take into consideration are the “Theory of Change” and the “Source to Sea Approach”, the second one mainly through scientific studies led or shared by SIWI’s Platform. Marine Pollution is a huge threat, and plastic pollution is just the top of the iceberg, the most visible layer of this problem. We must consider the invisible biological and chemical contaminants that arrive in the Ocean causing eutrophication, acidification etc. New technologies have to be developed to tackle this problem at the same time consumers must understand they need to do other choices to minimize these threats. More than 80% of marine pollution is generated in land. The follow up mechanisms are guided by SDG6 and SDG14 targets, which means that each project developed by Acqua Mater – conferences, mentorships, consultancies, training courses etc –will consider them to measure the progress of this action-oriented commitment. Another way to measure its advance is by leading change while influencing all its partners, encouraging them to replicate and scale these actions by bridging SDG6 and SDG14 as part of a global movement.","The Source to Sea Approach has already been considered a way to protect all water bodies, fresh or salty water, inland or in the Ocean, while promoting this integrated vision, showing us that everything is interconnected. If those who work for the implementation of SDG 14 start to cooperate with those who work for the implementation of SDG 6 targets, and vice versa, the benefits for them both will be complemented and empowered, since there are common agendas. Considering targets: 6.1. in some countries, safe drinking water is a desalinated water, as we can see in Israel or in Qatar; 6.2. improve the access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all is something that impacts directly the ocean. In places where people are working for a sustainable ocean, or even in coastal areas developed to encourage sustainable tourism, the water and sanitation sector will benefit from these initiatives. Furthermore, in many countries vulnerable women and girls are receiving from the government or NGOs menstrual collectors, what reduces the amount of plastic in traditional absorbents that could end in the ocean; 6.3. this target benefits the ocean directly. In the other hand, those which are working for a healthy ocean will create positive impact on this target, since more than 80% of the ocean pollution in generated inland. Besides that, companies that will emit blue bonds will benefit all water bodies. 6.4. The ocean works as a planetary air conditioner, since it allows the planet to be less warm than it was supposed to be due to the climate crisis. By protecting the ocean, extreme events, as droughts, can be reduced, and water scarcity can be less frequent; 6.5. / 6.6. What is a boundary? Does it separate or unites? Thinking “out of the box”, we can consider that transboundary cooperation can be also understood as the collaboration of those who work with deltas or mangroves. Going in the opposite direction, to protect seawaters we will necessarily work to protect all freshwater in the way back until we arrive in the mountains where the rain falls. 6.a / 6.b. In many countries, Ocean Literacy is becoming part of regional and/or national curriculums in formal and informal education. We have here a huge opportunity to bring to these educational contexts different information related to the challenges of the water & sanitation sector, especially when addressing developing countries and vulnerable people of local and coastal communities.","""Ocean Literacy With All"" Global Programme, an endorsed UN Ocean Decade Action coordinated by IOC-UNESCO; Ocean Stewardship Coalition from the UN Global Compact (Global); Canadian Ocean Literacy Coalition (Canada); Sustainable Ocean Alliance (Global and other international Hubs); Waterlution (Canada & Global); RELATO (Latin America Education Network for the Ocean); Planeta Océano (Peru); Eau DaCité (Canada); National Marine Educators Association (US); Oceanos Sanos (Uruguay); Ocean Alive Project (Caribbean); Nature Coaching Academy (Italy); Mermaid Federation International (Hong Kong); Galway Atlantaquaria (Ireland); Amiguitos del Océano (Ecuador); Womenvai (France); Blue Bioeconomy Collar (Portugal); UN Global Compact Brazil (Brazil); OceanPact (Brazil); BRK Ambiental (Brazil); Virada Sustentável (Brazil); Sustainable Development and Water for All (Brazil); Rivers & Streets (Brazil); (Brazil); Brazilian Women League for the Ocean (Brazil); IPESA - Instituto de Projetos e Pesquisas Socioambientais (Brazil); CIRAT - International Centre on Water and Transdisciplinarity (Brazil); Urban Sea Institute (Brazil); Association of Sabesp Engineers - AESabesp (Brazil).","Goal 4, Goal 6, Goal 11, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 14, Goal 15, Goal 17","4.7, 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 11.4, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.8, 12.a, 13.1, 13.3, 13.b, 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.5, 14.a, 14.c, 15.1, 15.3, 17.6, 17.17","Tue, 01/31/2023 - 12:00","Sun, 12/15/2030 - 12:00",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_RSeBQ8KOjM&t=13s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W740g2Shb7s https://oceanliteracy.unesco.org/ocean-literacy-with-all/ https://oceanliteracy.unesco.org/?post-types=all&sort=popular https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xk_LD5DiDSI&t=54s Panel https://www.oceanliteracydialogues.com/sessions/blueeconomy https://oceanliteracy.unesco.org/public-private-partnerships-for-ocean-literacy-cop27/,1.0,0.5555555555555556,0.6666666666666666,0.125,1.0,1.0

The objective of the project is creating an accessible space that will allow experts, technicians and managers from all around the world to learn about the most recent technical innovations and to translate them within concrete projects in their own countries. 
The project will have as partners institutions who will cooperate in training, research and development in each of their fields of expertise.
The project adopts various implementation methodologies, each aimed at covering a specific aspect of the knowledge chain withholding a transversal and transnational approach. First of all, it will support the activation of joint research that will see a close collaboration with public companies and authorities to allow a comprehensive view on necessities within national and local policies
Furthermore, exchange will be encouraged through specific study and research visits that will involve policy makers, technicians and researchers: each will get the chance of sharing their own institutional and training activities with the others, favoring a collaborative environment
Collaboration will also be aimed through the involvement of post graduate courses and the implementation of co-tutorship procedures between the partner institutions within the programme of Master of Science or even research doctorates. This will consequently allow a constant exchange of information and documents of scientific interest along with the participation of partner institutions’ experts in meetings, seminars, conferences and workshops.
The fertile ground of the International Water School will also represent the perfect context for implementing innovative training initiatives and scientific and communication events that will also see the collaboration with other Italian and foreign institutions. Finally, each participating partner will make their respective structure available to carry out common research and training programmes or programmes of interest to the other parties, in compliance with the relevant access and use regulations.

            Doubling the income of 60000 farmers","We have already directly installed 532 Bhungroos for poor famers and over 5000 Bhungroo have been installed as part of government policy benefitting 150,000 poor farmers. SGIF trained over 2000 climate leaders. It has also generated jobs at the local level for local people.","Bangladesh, Ghana, India, Rwanda, Vietnam","Africa, Asia and Pacific","Capacity development of women and youth as climate leaders and micro-entrepreneurs in the field of climate adaptive technologies like Bhungroo, is an important step in addressing the impacts of climate change. By training and empowering women and youth in the use and implementation of these technologies, they can become leaders in their communities and promote the adoption of sustainable practices. Bhungroo is a low -cost and easy -to-install rainwater harvesting technology that helps to recharge groundwater and improve crop yields. By training women and youth in the installation and maintenances of Bhungroo, they can become micro-entrepreneurs, offering these services to their communities and earning an income while also helping to mitigate the impacts of climate change. Capacity development programs can include training in technical skills, such as installation and maintenance of Bhungroo, as well as in business and entrepreneurship, such as marketing and financial management. Additionally, providing access to resources such as credit and networking opportunities can also support their success as micro-entrepreneurs. Bhungroo (straw or hollow pipe) filters, injects and stores storm water subsoil. It has 17 technical designs for a variety of agro-climatic zones and can be customized based on 27 variables. It works in environments where annual rainfall ranges from 400 to 2,100 millimeters, in salt affected and seasonally eroded soil. Using only one square meter surface area, each Bhungroo augments 1 to 4 Mlts of water/year and allows farmers to retrieve stored water. Multiple Bhungroos with a serial injection model can be used in flooded areas to capture and store excess water. The Climate Leaders (CL) program trains women and youth smallholder farmers to provide fee-based services to other smallholder farmers in their village. CLs undertake Bhungroo feasibility and preliminary geo-hydro studies, supervision of Bhungroo erection and distribution of irrigation water. CLs are paid by farmers for providing these services. Additionally, poor women smallholder farmers who own a Bhungroo earn income from the sale of crops and from helping other smallholders in their village gain access to water. Without a Bhungroo or CL advice, farmers are at risk of harvesting one or no crops per year. Bhungroo and CL services, enable farmers to harvest two crops a year and access threefold increase in income, increases in soil productivity, reduction in salt deposition of topsoil, and reclaimed land from desertification. In addition to economic and environmental benefits, women smallholder farmers have reported increases in land ownership and social status. With a 30-year life-span, each Bhungroo frees 5-10 acres from waterlogging in each monsoon and irrigates 22+ acres each winter. 1 to 4 million liters of runoff are conserved by each Bhungroo. It ensures food-security to 30-100 rural poor. Each unit generates income of approximately USD $5700+ per year and family-income rises from $189 to $710 in last 5 years. Overall, capacity development programs for women and youth in climate adaptive technologies like Bhungroo can help to promote sustainable practices and build resilience to the impacts of climate change, while also providing income-generating opportunities for women and youth.","Bhungroo is a technology that can help to achieve several of the targets of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG)6, which aims to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Specifically, Bhungroo can help to achieve the following targets: 1. Target 6.1: By 2020, achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all. We all know that we are still to far to achieve this target. Bhungroo can help to increase access to safe and affordable drinking water by harvesting and recharging ground water, which can be used for drinking and other domestic purposes. 2. Target 6.2. By 2030, achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all and end open defecation, paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations. Bhungroo can help to improve sanitation by increasing access to water for hand washing and other hygiene practices, and by reducing the need for open defecation. 3. Target 6.4: By 2030, substantially, increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity and substantially reduce the number of people suffering from water scarcity. Bhungroo can help to increase water-use efficiency by recharging groundwater, reducing the need to withdraw water from surface sources, and by increasing crop yields, which can reduce the pressure on water resources. 4. Target 6.5: By 2030, implement integrated water resources management at all levels, including through transboundary cooperation as appropriate. Bhungroo can be implemented at the community level and can help to promote integrated water resources management by increasing access to water and reducing dependence on surface sources. overall, Bhungroo is a low-cost and easy-to-install technology that can contribute to the achievement of several targets of SDG 6, by increasing access to safe and affordable drinking water, improving sanitation and hygiene, increasing water-use efficiency, and promoting integrated water resources management.","The details of present partners and offer of partnerships are as follows: Asia: Bangladesh- Already partners with CRS and six NGOs, 4 partnership offers (cutting across Non profit, MFI and private enterprises) Vietnam - Oxfam and one private entrepreneur namely ADASTRA Indonesia- discussion started with department of science and technology of Indonesian government for training Malaysia- ADASTRA (a private enterprise - it is HQ ed in Kuala Lumpur) - they are discussing partnership offers in Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Pakistan- one private enterprise jointly own by Shahid and Shahnawaz. online training has started Africa Kenya- government promoted autonomous body ACTS. we have jointly submitted proposal to government. we have also trained government staff members NIGERIA- 1 non profit and one government organization namely Niger River Development Authority. we are submitting joint proposal Uganda- Women Feed Africa run by Moses and Israeli agri company Namibia- Ebikes (one German for profit company for solar pumping agency)- we all are now part of women feed Africa movement cutting across all desert areas of Africa, managed from Namibia Small Island nations Antigua (by former Prime Minister of Antigua) - he is keen to have our support for minimization of loss during sudden rain and scarcity of water during summer",Goal 6,"6.2, 6.a, 6.b","Sun, 01/01/2023 - 12:00","Thu, 01/31/2030 - 12:00","Social enterprise website: https://www.naireetaservices.com You tube channel : Bhungroo facebook page : @naireetaservices Twitter: @bhungroo Key documents visit print media page of website of naireetaservices The details of key awards: 1.

Indeed, we had to use new technologies, such as artificial intelligence and IoT, and implement new methods, such as having a machine learning continuously improved with the knowledge of the expert to achieve such a goal: We were able to reduce the time of analysis by 96%. This first phase has enabled some unexpected outcome.
•	The faster than expected adoption of the users 
•	The ROI: calculated by only using the time saving is about a year, calculated by saving 1 servicing and repair can be less than 1 month 
•	Decisions and actions based on data, allowing to save more resources 
•	Detecting leakages that even experts were not able to detect “easily”
•	Improve water network efficiency to achieve about 90%
•	Keep and improve all the local expertise and water network specificity for more resilience
•	Change in habits and management of the team and knowledge 
We kept improving the tool with users ‘feedback that the tool became their companion doing all the low valuable job daily, so, users can focus on making decision about servicing, preventive servicing, and investments. It also helped to gain more recognition from the city managers and get more funding based on data. Based also on increasing challenges, such as water scarcity and energy price 
More utilities are adopting this tool and keep asking new features. 
Scaling-up the spread of this easy-to-use tool with appropriate IoT is a solution to greatly improve water network efficiency by drastically decrease water leakage impact, drinkable water wastage , saving energy and chemical to produce water. 
This innovation won the best Sustainable AI Solution Neuron Award at WAICF 2022","Drinking Water: by improving water network efficiency, this solution is already decreasing water leakage by more than 50%, and helps to achieve water network efficiency of more than 90%, meaning saving drinking water
Water stress: by significantly saving drinkable water, water resource is less used, so, water stress is reduced and better managed
Water management: tackling specifically this topic since this solution is addressing water management challenges by monitoring, digitalise, understanding, and manage efficiently water and water network. It helps to reduce by 96% the time to analyse, so, water manager can focus on decision and actions
Efficiency: by maximizing water network efficiency near its maximum of 98%, it provides the best efficiency possible of provided drinking water
Participation: with dashboard, data visualisation, and real-time information and through string collaboration with existing cities, it helps to improve awareness for citizen and mayors to implement innovative solutions such as ""water social pricing"" and drinkable value awareness for wiser usage",Nevers City,"Goal 6, Goal 17","6.4, 6.b , 17.7, 17.17","Thu, 10/01/2020 - 12:00","Mon, 06/01/2026 - 12:00","https://www.villeintelligente-mag.fr/LACROIX-s-attaque-aux-pertes-d-eau-potable-dans-les-canalisations_a1410.html

A Vulnerability and Risk Assessment was conducted and the response was to restore a community reservoir built in 1893 by the British Government, which was lying in ruins and covered over by large trees (largely invisible to the community). The reservoir was 1 of 5 located in specially selected locations across the island that were built to provide villages with fresh water in times of drought. Barnes Hill has numerous mentions with records of letters of Administration and Communication in the Archives of Antigua and Barbuda. The reservoir has many stories, but Barnes Hill suffered from water shortages and was forced to get pipe borne water twice per week. Many times, this was not available and the village tank was required to be supplemented by a water truck weekly, as the catchment at times could only supply 1-2 buckets daily to each person.

The drought was so terrible during this period that the water of other ponds — although unfit for human consumption — was a great help as it could be used for washing. The reservoir is an important water management system and research in the archives have showed that the reservoir provided significant value to the history of the island and to the local community experience. The BHCDO Park has developed into a green recreational space where visitors and locals from can experience local culture, food, art, and have conversations with the people from the community. The taxi drivers who bring the guests will also benefit adding to their knowledge. Former Ambassadors from New Zealand, Germany and Australia has visited the BHCDO Park. It was one of the site visits selected by the Secretariat for the Convention on Biodiversity when Antigua hosted the training workshop for the Caribbean sub-region on ‘Community Based Monitoring, Indicators on Traditional Knowledge and Customary Sustainable Use and Community Protocols’ within the Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020, in December 2015.

School children across the island have also been using the site for education and knowledge learning. BHCDO is featured in the 6th National Report, in the Local Biodiversity Outlook 2, Global Biodiversity Outlook 5. The area, which was once a waste dump and covered with invasive bush, has now been transformed with a wide variety of different flowers and an abundance of plants grown for herbs, food, medicine and drinks. The birds, bees and bats contribute to pollination for food security. Incorporating local community governance and management showcasing community solutions for local to global actions shows synergies, mainstreaming and integration across many conventions meeting SDG and other global targets and agendas. Building partnerships and collaborations have contributed greatly to capacity development with benefits to resilience building , climate adaptation programs, DRR, restoration of terrestrial and fresh water ecosystems with multiple benefits to income generation and livelihoods from sustainable tourism activities..","By sharing this story of local community actions to cope with and mitigate the drough, I know audiences can be impacted and people encouraged to be proactive and not to wait for governments to act. It requires people with a personal commitment to make a start for things to happen. The actions of one person can make a difference and have rippling impacts for the health of people and our environment. Such sharing helps to removes feelings of doubt of weakness, invisibility no recognition but shows how local champions are created. The sharing will also show the multiple positive actions of this community based initiaitive-actions on community empowerment, how national and global visibility is enhanced, how a wide range of local actors and stakeholders are drawn to programs on the ground that are people centered, that contributes positively to biodiversity, climate change, land degradation. The transformation enables and brings new voices into environmental decisión making as seen in the articles in the Escazu Agreement being implemented at the community level. The Project shows how partnerships and collaborations are built many starting through relationships-just from a conversation. The impacts and contributions to national and community development have extended to mobilizing actions in other communities who are faced with similar wáter problems and through peer and Exchange visits, support and actions taking place to replicate community actions in other villages such as Freetown who too have a reservoir. Community based adaptation initiatives not only link nature and culture to biodiversity but the synergies with other conventions are positively taking place at the national level on the ground-dispelling the crisis and beliefs of siloed conventions and the ongoing call for the conventions to work together. Such actions are taking place at the local level and such learning processes must be shared at this UN Water Conference.. The restoration of the reservoir facility has led to other positive impacts such as the creation of a Nature Park and hertitage site base don its history and the finding in the national archives but also the characterization as an Other Effective Area-based Conservation Measures (OECMs) is a work in progress for Target 3 of the Global Biodiversity Framework coming out of the Dec Montreal meetings. The proactive actions and efforts have created high Biodiversity values in the area, which was once a waste dump and covered with invasive Bush.The transformational change can be seen with the changes taking place. The wide variety of different flowers and an abundance of plants grown for herbs, food, medicine and drinks. The birds visiting the area are contributing to pollination and the village once known as the ‘sugar apple capital’ of Antigua is regaining its name through the reforestation of native trees. Tree planting has been a hallmark for the park.. Life, health and ecosystems are being restored. These transformations are having positive impacts on the people and on nature and the audience participating in the side event will leave inspired to take actions.

Organic wastes are valuable natural resources that are needed in the food chain to sustain life in their constant cycling of enzymes, amino acids and micro-nutrients essential for the healthy genetic development of every species on earth. 

By making fresh fermenting products with the organic wastes, such as liquid extracts, that can be added to the column of water in impacted waterways, polishing effluent water at wastewater treatment plants, adding the extracts to dairy lagoons and areas where open sewage and carcass decay or discharged industrial chemicals are affecting the surface and ground waters, we can utilize the energy and electron transport mechanisms in the organic wastes to break down excessive nutrients harming the environment.","Utilizing fermenting industrial organic wastes to reduce nutrients in our waterways will eventually teach us how to manage all of our organic wastes. Although pre-consumer food-grade organic wastes are the choice substrates to add to water, due to their obligatory testing for pathogenic bacteria, all organic wastes can be fermented to revive top-soil. The improvement of the top-soil and its microbiome will help plants be more resilient to heat and drought and increase the nutrient content of our food.

Due to the excessive energy in organic wastes, this method can also be used to break down and bioremediate contamination in soil and legacy contaminants sequestered in the sediment layers of creeks, rivers and lakes. By reducing the nutrients and contaminants in tributaries, lakes, and rivers we will improve the filtration capacity of coastal wetlands and prevent much of the raw sewage and heavy nutrient loading from point-source and runoff contaminants from reaching the oceans. 

By proving we can reduce nutrients in waterways by adding fermented liquid extracts from organic wastes, we will educate people on all levels that our organic wastes are too valuable to dispose of in landfills and stop the practice of the incineration of organic wastes. As we research the exact mechanisms of how organic wastes reduces nutrients in waterways, we will discover the fermenting organic wastes also increase nutrient absorption in plants from the naturally occurring nutrients in the soil, as well as the organic wastes and other fertilizers and soil amendments. In this way we can reduce the synthetic fertilizers added to farming operations that create the agricultural runoff situation contributing the the die-off of our waterways and oceans. 

As the market value of organic wastes improves, and more people become interested in salvaging these natural resources, we will create new industries to support the production of fermenting water and soil additives, as well as many other life-enhancing products.",Partners pending funding,"Goal 2, Goal 6, Goal 14","14.1, 14.3, 2.4 , 6.3, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b","Fri, 01/27/2023 - 12:00","Wed, 12/31/2025 - 12:00",We have conducted a demonstration in a constructed wetland in Texas.

Key goals of this initiative will be (a) to make developing countries more independent in national data generation, (b) make water projects in developing countries more sustainable and consequential and (c) reduce technical gaps between developed and developing countries. As such the development of the global network is game changing and will focus on establishing, developing and coordinating national technical capacity in water analysis. The initial network will have regional sub-networks in Africa, Latin America Caribbean, Asia and the Pacific, and Central Asia and will incorporate SIDS and partnerships between developed and developing countries will be encouraged to support the growth of network nodes. Member States and laboratories can apply to be one of three different types of nodes within the network: Anchor, Growth and Development nodes depending on the existing skills and capacity. These nodes can be further supported through twinning with established laboratories. The IAEA would provide support and stewardship for the network through upscaling and acceleration of the IAEA’s technical capacity development programme which is available to all IAEA Member States. It would respond to requests for assistance to support growth and development of nodes through its existing mechanisms but also work with partners to upscale the required financial investment and to facilitate connections between laboratories and other relevant stakeholders. The IAEA has a strong track record in developing and operationalizing other networks including the African Food Safety Network (AFROSAN), the Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory network (VETLAB), and the Analytical Laboratories for the Measurement of Environmental Radioactivity network (ALMERA). These network have made significant differences in their fields and it is anticipated that the new water laboratory network will have the same impact for SDG6.","Data and analysis have consistently been identified as key concerns of Member States in their ability to meet the goals of SDG6 and the Water Action Decade. The availability of laboratory services capable of generating reliable data in a timely manner is the cornerstone of any country's capacity to better understand and manage their water resources and to plan, implement and interrogate actions that support national water governance and resilience of supply. Laboratory priorities in the water sector should be established jointly with other national priorities, particularly food and agriculture, human health and minerals and energy sectors, that also depend on functioning national laboratories. The IAEA would underpin the network that would otherwise be supported through collaboration with other partners within the intergovernmental system. Whilst the laboratory itself would form the core of the network, it is recognized that laboratories exist to support water resource management. This requires (1) the design and implementation of water management projects that generate samples for the laboratory to analyze as well as (2) processing and interpretation of the data generated and translation of results into “usable” information for water managers. In order to achieve all the actions above, the network will work with other UN Agencies and international, regional, and national organizations as relevant to operationalize the network and has formed strong partnerships with UNEP, UNESCO and WMO to do this. Additional support for capacity development and the generation of transformational data products is provided by IHE-Delft, IGRAC and EAWAG. New partners are encouraged to approach the IAEA about how they can support the network and its objectives. This initiative will link with other important initiatives of UN Water including the Capacity Development Initiative, and the Science-Based Global Water Assessment Mechanism. Linkages to other game-changes and initiatives are continuously being developed to enable Member States to fill knowledge gaps and independently generate their own water data specifically targeted to helping them achieve the objectives of SDG6.","Partners in this initiative involve both UN entities, research organisations, higher education and government ministries.

Pour répondre efficacement à ce défi, la mise en oeuvre du Programme Sectoriel Eau, Hygiène et Assainissement sera intensifié en vue d’améliorer l’accès à l’eau potable en milieu urbain, rural et pastoral. Le financement pour l’hydraulique rurale et urbaine sera porté de 3% en moyenne actuellement à 7% du budget national à l’horizon 2026. 
A cet effet, les programmes opérationnels d’hydraulique seront centrés sur la construction de nouveaux points d’eau modernes et les réhabilitations avec notamment, la systématisation des Adductions d’Eau Potable Multi-Villages, la transformation des forages équipés de pompes à motricité humaine en Postes d’Eau Autonomes ainsi que le renforcement de l’accès dans les zones difficiles. Au total, 30 000 nouveaux équivalents points d’eau modernes (éqPEM) seront construits et 5 000 autres seront réhabilités sur la période du Plan. 
Concernant l’hydraulique pastorale, qui est un sous-secteur essentiel au Niger le maillage des points d’eau sera renforcé avec la réalisation de stations de pompage pastorales et de puits cimentés pastoraux. Ainsi, 4 500 nouveaux équivalents points d’eau modernes (éqPEM) seront construits et 500 autres seront réhabilités. 
L’objectif poursuivi en matière d’hydraulique urbaine est l’optimisation des centres concédés avec un accent sur la sécurité hydrique de la ville de Niamey et les capitales régionales et l’intégration des nouveaux centres dans le périmètre concédé à la Société de Patrimoine des Eaux du Niger (SPEN).","En ce qui concerne l’hydraulique villageoise, il s’agit d’assurer la croissance continue de l’accès à l’eau potable sur l’ensemble du territoire national afin d’atteindre un taux de couverture géographique de 95% et un taux d’accès de 55% à l’horizon 2026, une meilleure application de la politique de recouvrement des coûts et la réduction des disparités inter et intra régionales dans l’accès à l’eau.
L’objectif poursuivi en matière d’hydraulique urbaine est d’atteindre un taux de desserte en eau potable de 100% dans les 55 centres concédés à la SPEN, à travers la réalisation de 460 000 branchements particuliers et 10 000 bornes fontaines.
Les résultats attendus représenteront une avancée considérable vers l’atteinte de l’ODD 6.1., même si les taux d’accès optimum, et même basique, aux services de l’eau potable seront loin d’être atteints en 2030.

Or how to achieve sustainable rural operators for US$4/person

Most rural water supply and sanitation problems are related to management and governance (UNDP, 2022). We have never taught rural operators how to self-manage.
HOW DO WE DO THIS?
At FESAN, as a result of 14 years of field training, we have developed a Model for Sustainable Management, MSM, based on social innovation and governance, local culture, management of quality drinking water and sanitation service processes, proven participatory work methods and tools accessible to all.
WHAT DO WE ACHIEVE?
Instead of assisted rural operators, achieve EMPOWERED AND SELF-SUSTAINABLE SOCIAL ENTERPRISES, to:
Maintain the health, well-being and development of rural communities
Decrease government technical assistance expenses
Ensure sustainable operation of the works delivered by the State / National government

HOW TO ACHIEVE MSM AS THE UNIVERSAL ACCESIBLE ALPHABET  for all rural operators in LAC in order to accompany them in their evolution towards sustainability?  
Our Best Practice Manual is …  Easy to understand and adaptable to any type of rural operator, any cultural/territorial context and any LAC country.
Practical, to encourage organizations to take practical steps and introduce gradual change (learning by doing)
Constantly updates itself based on the management experiences of operators

            Testing of the thrust of the water, volume, and safety Digging of water wells",Visitors and next Generation,Sierra Leone,Africa,"Millions of people living in rural and urban Sierra Leone and Africa at large rely on water wells
or boreholes for their daily water needs. The general objective of this project is to provide fifty
boreholes to schools, hospitals, Orphanage homes, and deprived communities in Tonkollili
district, Port Loko district, and Freetown Urban area with safe drinking water. This project will
help to enhance the lives of the people living in these areas, thus uplifting their standards of
living through pure, dignified, and safe drinking water. The intention of this project is to

accomplish the digging of fifty hand-dug well and a jack pump attached to each of the boreholes
to serve 1, 500 vulnerable families in each location within Sierra Leone. Furthermore, the project
will help the beneficiaries of these communities in the following ways:
A. Increased accessibility of safe and adequate water supply within their communities
B. Availability of water for an irrigation system to sustain Agricultural activities.
C. Reduction of time consumed in fetching water.
D. Provision of sufficient water for livestock.
In addition to the above, the project intends to help in saving the time spent by most of the
schools’ going children, young women and girls of their day collecting water. This time can be
better spent on activities such as household work, school and working on farms to supplement
their daily avenues of income. According to surveys done, the borehole will have a depth of
approximately 30 metres, However, our priority is to have the borehole dug first as it will serve
more beneficiaries within these communities. This is because the borehole can produce more
water for the beneficiaries. The process of digging boreholes will be as follows. First off, the site
will be identified after the geologist report is done. Then excavation of the soil will be done up to
30 meters. The construction of the inner wall of the well then is done by four men
taking alternate shifts. Two inside the well and two ferrying the sock and soil out of the hole. A
pump will then be laid inside the well to facilitate efficient water fetching. The services of
a proper engineer will not be required as this is a task normally done by manual laborers. The
borehole’s location has not been identified yet. This will be done during the preliminary construction","Since this project is intended to benefit the society in three districts and future generations, it is
essential that mechanisms for sustainability are put in place. Sustainability will be obtained
through sensitization of the community on how the different appliances can be used when
handling them. Furthermore, seminars on various irrigation techniques and other crops
that can flourish in the climatic conditions of three districts in Sierra Leone can also be done.
Locals can also be hired to manage the boreholes as well as jack pump and conduct repairs
classes that will equip them with knowledge of how to construct boreholes and jack pump when
the need may arise.
This new and additional action accelerates SDG implementation, and will Even though more than three-quarters of the mass of the Earth is made up of water, accessing
usable water is a challenge for quite several communities within Sierra Leone area, specifically
Northern Province. Young women and little girls often must endure treks for long distances to
fetch and head carry just a small amount of water for drinking. The little that is left is used in
other household activities. This has led to high rates of malnutrition, environmental degradation,
as well as water-borne diseases arising from poor sanitary conditions, and, ultimately, wastage of
a lot of resources in fetching water. These cases of malnutrition and water-borne diseases lead to
high rates of infant mortalities. The community living in these areas is composed of many
mining companies and of livestock farmers. It is often a challenge to get water for the livestock.
For these reasons, it is important for a solution to be promptly provided for them.","Partners: Reach Salone, Community Initiative for Peace and Children Foundation, United for the Protection of HumanRight Advocacy Network - Sierra Leone, Ministry of the Environment Sierra Leone, Ministry of Water Resources Sierra Leone, Environmental Protection Agency

            Mobilization of CTA signatories so they can, based to their resources, set up an enabling environment, by mobilizing their partners and positioning themselves on the 5 points of the CTA","Populations living in Fragile, Conflict, and Violent settings",Switzerland,Global,"In order to achieve the SDG6, it is essential not to forget populations living in Fragile, Conflict and Violent settings (FCV), which represent 23% of the world's population (OECD). The past decade has seen an unprecedented frequency and density of humanitarian interventions. In 2021, HIIK's Conflict Barometer counted 355 conflicts worldwide, nearly three times as many as in the 1990s.
In addition to being more numerous, crises are also becoming more complex: humanitarian organizations face a wide range of crisis, from those triggered by environmental or climatic factors, to protracted conflict-related crises, with aggravating factors such as migration, urbanization and climate change.

Currently, humanitarian WASH actors do not have capacity and resources to respond to the ever growing-needs and demands.Indeed, humanitarian funds dedicated to the WASH sector represented only 21% of the amount requested during Humanitarian Response Plans. This is particularly worrying when the total amount of people in need is increasing every year, from 80 million in 2013 to 339 million in 2023. In addition, according to the 2018 SOHS, barely half of humanitarian programs meet their objectives on time and with an acceptable level of quality.

To tackle these gaps, over thirty of the world's most active actors in the humanitarian WASH sector -such as international NGOs, United Nations agencies, universities- have created a unprecedented collective to work collaboratively in order that by 2025, the humanitarian WASH sector will have the capacity and resources to deliver qualitative responses at scale, anywhere and anytime.

Together, they developed and committed to implement the WASH Road Map (WRM), a set of 16 global initiatives organized in four working groups related to (i) better management of access to information and knowledge, (ii) capacity building and professionalization of humanitarian workers worldwide, (iii) strengthening inter-sectoral coordination and innovative partnerships, (iv) higher-level advocacy and resource mobilization.

As part of the advocacy initiative, WRM actors have undertaken actions to urge governments to commit to take tangible actions to strengthen the WASH sector in FCV settings. Today, WRM actors are concerned by the lack of attention given to specific WASH challenges in FCV settings during past water high-level events and proceedings (e.g. 2022 Dakar declaration and 2021 High Level Political Forum).

They developed a Call to Action and strong substantial advocacy strategy for UN Member States to maximize its visibility and resonance. Advocacy actions include relentless communication on social networks to maximize the number of signatories (target 200 signatory organizations); facilitating external WRM actors to appropriate themselves CTA messages thanks to already-built visuals, social media messages, an email signature, and a powerpoint slide; organizing internal and external side-events at the UN23WC, webinars, seminars; assuring a follow-up with signatories to inform them on the Water Action Agenda and to include them in future advocacy efforts, etc. The communication and dissemination actions of CTA will continue beyond the 2023 UN Water conference and a monitoring system of the commitments made by the States will be put in place until 2030.","The expected results of this call to action are as follows:

• That governments primarily focus their efforts towards those living in FCV settings. They are the most impacted by the multiple burdens of conflict, climate change, poverty, and hunger. A special focus should be given to countries with no evolution on the achievement of SDG6, and populations without even access to basic WASH services.

• That governments further support humanitarian WASH response and coordination to deliver predictable, effective (timely) and sufficient survival WASH responses and to ultimately safeguard the lives and health of those living in FCV contexts.

• That governments build sustainable and resilient WASH services that can withstand crises. Building back better and adapting existing systems, from infrastructures to communities, should be systematic especially in countries most exposed to multiple risks (climate crises, conflicts, natural disasters). In these contexts, collaboration between development and humanitarian actors at all levels from local to global will ensure continuity of services and better value for money. Together, let’s build services that last.

• That all governments actively promote the effective implementation of International Humanitarian Law obligations relevant to the protection of WASH personnel and UN Security Council Resolution 2573 (2021), including by promoting the identification and exchange of good practices in the protection of WASH infrastructure during armed conflict, supporting data collection on attacks on or impacting WASH infrastructures and their reverberating effects, and facilitating access to equipment, spare parts and consumables required to restore and maintain WASH services.

• That governments support the request to the UN General Secretary to nominate as soon as possible a UN Special Envoy for Water to establish a recurrent intergovernmental, UN-hosted, mechanism to discuss global water issues and to ensure the achievement of SDG 6 and all water- related SDGs

 

>These requests will directly impact the acceleration of the SDG-6:""It is only by including the most vulnerable that we can hope to reach the SDGs” (Call To Action – WRM). Through these five demands, the Call to Action tackles the lack of international attention, mediatization, political means, resources, and capacities invested in FCV contexts and in the WASH sector. It is only by strengthening the latter, the main provider of water and sanitation services in crisis situations, that we will be able to claim to have done everything possible to achieve the universal goals of SDG6.

Furthermore, water affects all aspects of development, and the WASH sector is intrinsically linked to other SDG-sectors such as health, food security, gender equality, education, reducing inequality, peace etc. As a vital element, water feeds economic development and contributes to the health of human beings. History has shown that investing in safe water and sanitation averts preventable deaths and transforms lives. This explains why CTA actors are inviting actors from other sectors and contexts to participate to this inter-sectorial/multi-sectorial effort by signing the document and by appropriating themselves the information and content of the CTA to side-events around the UN 2023 Water Conference and other conferences, events, seminars...","ACF (France, International and ROWCA), PFE, GTO, ICRC, IHE Delft, IHIP, IMC, NRC, SI, OXFAM, STC",Goal 6,"6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b","Fri, 12/30/2022 - 12:00","Mon, 12/30/2030 - 12:00","Twitter: @WASHRoadMap

In 2017, TSC realised that global capital markets arguably play the most significant role in the future of sustainable Water security and started to qualify and quantify ‘Water Risk’ as a direct portfolio and investment risk. TSC then set about the task of creating an innovative family of Water Risk indices for an institutional audience, and by October 2020 the company started working with Anatase Ltd and Moorgate Benchmarks Ltd (since 2022, part of Morningstar Index Services) to further refine and develop these indices and ultimately calculate and provide independent governance. A further partnership with Refinitiv, a leading data provider (London Stock Exchange Group), was created to provide important Water-specific data for the methodology of the world's first family of Water security indices. As part of the development of these indices, the concept of ‘Water footprint’ was born, and is considered to be a ‘first’ for global capital markets. Importantly, the ‘Water footprint’ of the TSC Water Security Index family is on average 50% lower than that of the traditional equity benchmarks of MSCI World, S&P500 and EuroSTOXX 50.
Over the past 5 years, TSC has emerged as one of the world’s most vocal thought-leaders in developing fund solutions for global Water security. As part of a global network of leading academics in water and climate security, collaboration with the United Nations, the World Economic Forum, and participating in the NGO Ceres launch of the Valuing Water Finance initiative, TSC continues to demonstrate a commitment, connectivity and expertise unrivaled in the cross-over between Water appreciation and commercial realities.
When the Valuing Water Finance Initiative was launched in August 2022, TSC was one of original signatories, with 62 other global firms, with over $10 trillion in assets under management. Furthermore TSC is a regular contributor to leading financial titles such as FINTECH.TV, Responsible Investor, Bloomberg, Barron's, Environmental Finance, Global Capital, Green Money Journal, Board Agenda, IR Magazine, Climate & Capital Media publications, underscoring their position and influence in the pursuit of advancing global Water security.","All actions accelerate SDG 6 education, awareness, information, investments, implementation","United Nations, Ceres Valuing Water Finance Initiative, Citigroup, Citi National Bank/Royal Bank of Scotland, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, JP Morgan Chase, Morningstar",Goal 6,"6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b","Mon, 01/23/2023 - 12:00","Mon, 01/31/2033 - 12:00",thomasschumanncapital.com,1.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

1. Among local an regional Youth and BIPOC community, increase awareness, engagement and educational activities on the healing properties of water (oceans, rivers, lakes, etc), the history of water relations in the US and small island states, and the importance of restoring relationships to our natural waterways for personal and community healing as well as the need to protect these waterways for sustenance, employment and survival. Our partnership does this currently through
a) weekly water-based healing community of practice, nature-based healing retreats, and contemplative clean-up and conservation, on historic black beaches and other spaces where water is a natural feature,
b) education and advocacy for petitions on right to clean water at community events, within the SE climate network education sessions and convenings, and in social media outlets,
c) film screenings on the history of water access, exclusion and trauma which led to current disengagement and disempowerment of BIPOC in being part of the water conversation, and documentaries / panels on the scientifically-proven healing properties of water
d) partnership with indigenous elders to provide education on traditional ecological practices to protect and restore natural waterways.
2. Increase training and employment of lifeguards and water-related experts for Women, Youth and BIPOC community who then serve within those communities where drowning rates as well as pollution are high.
Currently implementing through a) community adult learn to swim programs b) diversity in aquatics classes and lifeguard training.
3. Explicitly connect the water, well-being and climate justice movements through workshops, keynotes, panel discussions and experiential sessions in school and community settings, multi-sector regional and national networks and conferences, to shift the paradigm of engagement and action toward a more holistic approach to water issues. ","-Increase in resilience, economic empowerment in water industries among women, young adults and BIPOC community which in turn leads to increase advocacy, clean-up, and legislative action in coastal cities, waterways near urban areas. -Increase water literacy, increase resilience and reduce water trauma, and increase water safety (reduce drowning rates) in the south east USA among BIPOC community which leads to more grassroots effort and participation in protecting waterways via school and community based projects","Southeast Climate and Energy Network (over 80 Water and Climate NGOs in the Southeast USA)

Elles perturbent les systèmes économiques, politiques, environnementaux et sociaux, menacent aussi  la sécurité alimentaire et humaine et entravent les progrès dans le processus de développement du pays. Elles engendrent aussi des crises humanitaires d’ampleurs graves au niveau de nos populations qui se trouvent très souvent face à des besoins humanitaires multiples et multiformes. Parmi ces crises, les inondations qui sont de nos jours récurrentes causent beaucoup plus de dégâts. Une analyse rétrospective des pertes subies sur 40 ans (1973-2013) réalisée au Niger (DesInventar, 2016) a estimé à plus de 40 milliards de francs CFA de pertes annuelles dues aux inondations. Face à ces situations de crises et catastrophes, plusieurs actions d’atténuation et de protection de populations en général et de couches les plus vulnérables en particulier sont menées. L’inondation au Niger cette année a affectée  26.943 personnes (3.814 ménages) sinistrées et 4.108 maisons  effondrées. Des familles ont perdu des proches, leurs biens, cultures et animaux. Ces inondations touchent aussi bien les zones urbaines  que rurales. Dans les zones périurbaines de la région, les inondations sont devenues une réalité omniprésente qui affecte directement les  populations pauvres.
Lors des inondations, des points d'eau potable sont souvent contaminées et leur structure est atteinte ou même détruite. Des installations d'assainissement comme latrines privées, publiques et dans les institutions sont également rendues inaccessible ou leur structure atteinte ou détruite. Le risque et incidences de maladies hydriques monte donc fortement, si des interventions d'urgence rapide ne sont pas  entreprises. 
En 2021, le Niger a connu une importante épidémie de choléra qui a touché 7 des 8 régions du pays, avec un total de 5. 591 cas et 166 décès, dont les femmes (55% des cas, 47% des décès) ont payé le plus lourd tribut. Elle a touché principalement les régions frontalières avec le Nigeria (Tahoua, Maradi, Dosso et Zinder), le Tchad (Diffa) ainsi que les régions de Tillaberi et Niamey. EtAu cours de cette année 2022, nous avons enrégistré des cas . Cette épidémie est la cinquième de cette ampleur 
à affecter le pays au cours de la dernière décennie. Outre le choléra, la pandémie de la COVID-19 qui a affecté l’ensemble des 8 régions est toujours en cours avec un total de 8. 908 cas et 309 décès à la date du 21 Avril 2022. Les professionnels de santé, toutes catégories confondues, en ont payé un lourd tribut avec 6% (559 des cas enregistrés). C'est dans ce cadre que l'ONG ADESA, veut partager son expétise  sur l'innovation lié à l'urgence.","Afin de répondre aux besoins les plus urgents des populations affectées par l'inondation au Niger , Action pour le Développement du Sahel (ADESA) veut partager  son expertise  .

Recent studies confirm that new creative scientific approach can be available at the fringes of scientific community.  Encouragement is given to innovative driven NGOs eg DICIDE, with proven solution that gets women have sustainable healthy newborn considering the threat pollution, disease burden, ignorance, traditional beliefs, few health facilities and COVID-19 presents. Children can be born with maternal skill strategies that drastically reduce negative impact of environmental conditions on unborn child brain development. The game changer innovation is the development and implementation of Smart Maternal Skill Education (SMSE): The purpose is to eliminate climate change, water and environment threat on unborn child well-being. Since 2005, through seminars and conferences our team has trained over fifteen thousand Nigerians on maternal skill with rippling effect. The aim is to achieve sustainable healthy, creative intelligent children. It is beyond treatment or saving lives and targets next generation full potential through customized human growth and development. All are in an effort to ensure closing the global gab in inequality.

The Maternal Skill Education Course provides skills and strategies which get women have sustainable healthy newborn with fine potential. The strategies were product of evidence based studies in partnership with Bayero University Kano Nigeria 2003-2008 and supervised by Professor Danjuma Maiwada. The study Theme: Climate and Environmental Factors Affecting Human Wellbeing, Learning and Performance. The finding helped our team author two books: 1, UN SDG Maternal Skill Education, 2. Unborn-Child IQ Development Strategies. World Health organization defined Health as physical and emotional well being. Positive water and climate action helps mother and unborn child develop health and potential to close gap in inequality, good health, education, peace and justice. Science shows that adversity has detrimental effect on the physical and emotional development of unborn child and children. According to Professor James Leeckman, Director of Research, Yale University Child Study Center “There is need for positive Preconception and Early Child Care as children are in many ways the hidden victims of any pandemic and environmental issue”. Smart Maternal Skill education, gets prospective mothers play their part in their pregnancy. It is women and unborn child's first Human Right. It helps them drastically reduce maternal/child mortality and morbidity ratio common in developing countries and usher in smart next generation, innovators, entrepreneurs and technologists. https://www.dicideiq.org","World Health organization defined health as physical and emotional well-being. Emotional wellbeing starts from the preconception condition. The foundation and environment of unborn child play crucial role in its development. Thus the pollution and endemic condition of water and environment negate fetal development. 1. Attainment of United Nations sustainable development goal SDG target on child health as better maternal skill result to smarter healthier babies with high IQ points and APGAR scores. Emphasis is on closing inequality globally. 2. Maternal Health skill provide a foundation for newborn who become next generation, innovative smart intelligent entrepreneurs both in science and technology as newborn have high cognition. 3. Maternal Health Skill, preconception preparedness and adaptation result to women health throughout pregnancy and physiologically recover fast from child delivery. 4. Poverty, disease burden, malaria, malnutrition negatively affect quality health and costly. Maternal Skill empowers society to reduce drastically funding need for health care as women become skilled in it. The sustainable potential and performance of citizens require the status of their emotional energy, which is directly influenced by climate change and environmental condition.

To achieve the goals of the UN convention on Biological Diversity goals and the UN decade of Habitat Restoration, combined efforts for mainstreaming of successful solutions is needed. Efficient restoration of lakes and wetlands as well as the implementation of truly sustainable development strategies in lake regions require the collaboration of all stakeholders (authorities, NGOs, Academia, businesses etc.).
To improve and foster the cooperation for better lake and wetland management on global level, between 2022 and 2027 we will implement the Living Lakes Biodiversity and Climate Project. The project will focus on:
-	Capacity development on relevant aspects to improve sustainable management of lakes enhancing protection and restoration and the sustainable use of ecosystem services. Training modules and ma-terial will be developed for two target groups: lake managers and farmers/fishermen. There will be a focus on generating young leaders in both groups.
-	Demonstration of nature based solutions and pro-biodiversity-business for lake management and their transfer and replication into other lake regions. It is expected that regional and national govern-ments support the roll out of these solutions by dissemination, capacity development and financial support.
-	Based on a sound dissemination strategy, international events and networks, stakeholders of lake regions all over the world will be informed about the outputs and motivated and supported to use them and replicate in the case of the Frontrunner Initiatives.","The project contributes to the conservation and restoration of wetlands and protection of biological diversity and feeds into goals of the BIODEV2030, the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration 2021-2030 and the UN Water Agenda. With a focus on 10 implementing countries, the project will support the international lakes and wetlands community in LDCs, developing and emerging countries to implement the Strategic Plan of the CBD, the implementation and application of the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands and the UN Convention on the Protection and Use of Transboundary Water-courses and International Lakes (Peru/Bolivia). 
The project promotes the importance of the conservation of lakes and wetlands within the Global Water Agenda and SDGs and the UN International Decade for Action on Water for Sustainable Development, 2018-2028. The project will support the better integration of these policies and frameworks in national action plans (NBSAPs), re-gional and local management of lakes and wetlands as well as the strategies for the mobilisation of resources to implement these plans and strategies.   
With the activities in the 10 partner countries, the LLBCP will showcase and foster better practices for the protection and restoration of wetlands and improve the protec-tion of wetlands. Through replication projects, strengthening of international exchange and developing new strategic alliances within the project, the importance of lakes and wetlands as important habitats worthy of protection beyond the 10 project countries is expanded. 
The project will pay into the implementation of innovative practical approaches for water and wetland protection by part of conservation organisations, as well as the incorporation of wetland protection into relevant policies of governmental and non-governmental organisations around the world and in international regulatory frame-works e.g. SDGs and the Global Water Agenda. Mainstreaming will be targeted on national levels in the 10 implementing countries, as well as on regional and interna-tional level with support of the Living Lakes Network.

Now also we opt to work for the same community accepting them as our beneficiaries.",India,Asia and Pacific,"Water is omnipresent and it is found in the Sky, found in the Air, found in the Soil and found with all living beings. It is highly important to promote and accelerate the Global Economy, Global Climate, Global Health, Global Environment, Global Food Security and Consumption and Production System and Controls the Global warming. Water is our lifeline that bears the Social values, Economical values and Cultural values. It is nourishing the living world, so can be told as the mother of the Living world and the elixir of life. The existence of the entire eco-system is based upon the availability of water resources where as the scarcity of water is the hour of the day due to rapid growth of population and rapid development in Industrial sector. Pollution of water is another curse for the human society which creates the misery and misfortune in the lives of the human beings. No doubt the pollution is increasing and it is increasing very fast due to Industrialization, Urbanization, Modernization and unification etc. Hence we should have a deeper understanding that pollution of water is the pollution in life. In fact, there is one conflict between the Nature and the Development. The Nature always wants Development, where as the Development is creating destructions. Hence, it needs to be conserved very carefully. Conservation of water is a broad concept that relates to River, Ponds, Lake, Ocean and Rainfall. In deeper sense, conservation is the worthy use of water to save all living beings beginning from vegetation to Human beings, because “Scarcity of Water may cause the extinction of the Living world”. Moreover, Water is the second supreme ingredient in the construction of Human Body next to Earth as per the mythological belief. Water is treated as the baseline element of life. India witnessed the first Human settlement and the positive impact of water that the ancient Civilization was grown at the River basins for the availability of abundant water resource located by the primitive tribal community for effective management of their lives. So, water plays an important role to save the lives and scarcity of water plays a negative role to turn the earth into Desert. Now, the present world is going to face the same crisis declared by the United Nations, because the ground water level is diminishing day by day. The destructive action of Human beings is mainly responsible for this situation. So, we should have a proper utilization and sustainable use of water with sanitary measures to have a healthy survival by the participation of the Community enterprise. Community Sector Partnership with proper supervision, monitoring, casual evaluations by the Project Holder and the Supervising staff will bring a significant result. Moreover, the priority should be given on the women mass as a token of Gender Equalization for an effective implementation as the women worship the water as their God and they can dedicate to save the living beings on this Earth and to save the Planet.","The Aims and Objects of this Project are to save the lives and to save the Planet. Community sector Partnership is the best method to achieve these objects and by implementing this project we can streamline the drinking water crisis. Moreover, the Health of the People, Health of the Nature and Environment, Health of Wildlife and Domestic animals and the Health of the Soil can be maintained properly, the ground water level will rise and the Biodiversities will grow faster, the agricultural production of the people will increase, the socio-economic standard of the people will develop, they will get clean water to drink and will never face any water-borne Disease. We can also promote the sustainable Eco-Agriculture which is definitely a Lively-hood support opportunity to accelerate the Consumption and Production Economy, provide Food Security, Health Security, Financial Security, check Soil erosion, Combat Desertification and the Forest Landscape will be restored, there will also be a significant impact on the Habitats and Climate Change Crisis. Eco-Agriculture is also for elimination of Poverty and Hunger. The crop is Eco-friendly, Climate friendly, Climate resilient, Climate smart, Carbon smart, Water smart and Energy smart and provides Food Security, Health Security, Financial Security, Employment opportunity and checks the Migration and Displacement, Degradation of land and Soil erosion and Inter-cropping can be done and 3-4 crops can be produced by which we can combat the Migration and Displacement. Moreover, we can promote the Herbal Medicines, Control the Pollution and avoid different type of Natural Calamities and different diseases like Cancer, Asthma and Tuberculosis etc in order to accelerate the human life-cycle and to have a healthy survival. We will also prioritize on educative awareness programmes to educate the people on water sanitation.  
As a result of execution of this project (SDG-14), we can implement the SDG 01(No poverty), SDG 02 (Zero Hunger), SDG 03 (Good Health and Well-Being), SDG 05 (Gender Equality), SDG 06 (Clean water and Sanitation), SDG 08 (Decent work and Economic Growth), SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Production), SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 15 (Life on Land) and our community members will avail lots of benefits out of this project. 
LINKAGE PROGRAM:
The project shall be linked to Gender Equalization by educating the women on Land management, Soil management and Fertilizer application, small business like Mushroom cultivation, Bee keeping, Poultry Farming, Soap and Surf making to strengthen the livelihood. Moreover, they shall be the good assets for their family and for the Country, they can strengthen their future, their leadership quality will develop and they can raise their voice against exploitation and social injustice, women trafficking, face the anti-social elements of the society and there shall be a significant impact on the women of the nearby villages. Tribal women are very sensitive and very active. They play a dramatic role to take care of their families and they know the proper utilization of water. So, for an effective implementation we should involve them in this project activity.","UNEP, UNGC, UNCCD and IUCN.","Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 3, Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 8, Goal 12, Goal 13, Goal 14, Goal 15","1.1, 1.2 , 1.3 , 1.4, 1.5, 1.a, 1.b, 2.1 , 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 , 2.5, 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.6, 3.7 , 3.9, 3.a, 3.b, 5.1 , 5.2, 5.3, 5.4 , 5.5, 5.6, 5.a, 5.b, 5.c , 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 8.1, 8.2 , 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.7 , 8.8, 8.9, 12.1, 12.2, 12.3, 12.5, 12.6, 12.7, 12.8, 12.a, 12.b, 12.c, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.a, 13.b, 14.1, 14.3, 14.7, 14.a, 14.b, 14.c, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5, 15.6, 15.7, 15.a, 15.b, 15.c","Sat, 04/01/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 03/31/2026 - 12:00","Everything is found in our website.

It is currently hosted by the World Bank, Water Global Practice in collaboration with 20 institutional partners.   Its experience in supporting gender equality in the water workforce points to the positive combination of quantitative benchmarking using a systematic framework on the drivers of gender diversity, together with training and capacity building, and peer-to-peer support for those undertaking such change within water institutions, while bringing partners together to share tools, resources and joint learning.   This combination has helped a number of water institutions increase the gender representation of women in decision-making positions in water and sanitation utilities.    Research has shown that such representation is an important element not only in enhancing female voice and influence on programs and policies, but in overall performance and in responsiveness to the specific needs of women – as highlighted in several SDGs.   This commitment seeks to scale up such benchmarking, capacity building, and dissemination of the Equal Aqua approach to accelerate and facilitate more gender diverse water institutions.","Fostering more diverse water institutions with equal representation of women in decision-making positions not only accelerates advancement of gender equality (SDG 5), increasing evidence points to its contribution to other Sustainable Development Goals in a variety of ways.   Social research has shown that where women are in leadership or decision-making positions, they are more likely to listen and respond to the needs of female water users (as in Sub-Saharan Africa and many other parts of the world women and girls continue to play a predominant role in collection of off-site water), thus contributing to achievement of SDG6 in terms of universal access to water, sanitation and hygiene.   In addition, the specific focus on benchmarking, which provides quantitative baseline and opportunities to set targets, as well as comparators (through Scorecards and comparators to other regional and global water institutions) provides improved metrics on actual achievement of gender diversity outcomes.    A recent review of progress on gender inclusion under SDG6.5.1 by the Global Water Partnership highlighted the need for measures that go beyond policies to better capture and keep a focus on outcomes in order to accelerate progress.  Further, the partnerships under Equal Aqua accelerate the pace of joint learning and sharing of tools on how to achieve greater gender representation in water institutions and in water decision-making.   This is important to ensure that evidence on how to shift the complex social norms, incentives, policies and work culture that contribute to more equitable and diverse water workplaces inform action, and thus close the gap between intentions and outcomes.","Existing and future partners in the Equal Aqua platform may decide to opt in to participate in these commitments (Equal Aqua partners currently include: American Water Works Association (USA), Aguas y Saneamientos Argentinos S.A.

            Framework for transboundary groundwater resilience","Communities, economies, and ecosystems dependent on healthy transboundary aquifers and connected surface waters.","Mexico, Netherlands, Norway, United States of America",Global,"Objectives 1. Network of networks for healthy aquifers connecting hydrologic, social, and ecological systems.  
Objective 2. Action framework with concrete steps and timeline for actions to promote healthy transboundary community and aquifer systems worldwide.

The project seeks to expand and connect international and multidisciplinary networks interested in healthy groundwater systems to include multiple disciplines (social, economic, educational, political, etc.), across multiple scales (local to transboundary), and connecting new geographies. This will allow new water management schemes that are being used in other locations to inform new work and new groups through improved scientific communication. Data and information will become more accessible when information sharing and data sharing are encouraged within the expanding network. Likewise, the broader network will benefit the collaborations between sectors of diplomacy where the problems are similar. In conclusion, this project will help interested parties learn from each other. The discoveries and paths forward determined by the network will be the basis of and inform an action framework that lays out internationally agreed on steps and an achievable timeline for actions to promote healthy transboundary aquifer systems.

This initiative focuses on a data, systems, network, and community-based approach to identify leverage points and key drivers to foster transboundary groundwater resilience. We collaborate with networks and organizations in the Transboundary Groundwater Resilience (TGR) Network-of-Networks (NoN) to educate the public on FAIR data principles, spatial analysis, network analysis, and systems modeling through our seminars, workshops and panels.The partners will collaborate on developing data analysis and visualization tools and coupled natural and human systems models for policy analysis. The deliverables above provide a basis for the creation of templates, a generic model, and a framework for communities to increase their data, systems, and network knowledge and build their own models. 

We will build on past successes. The TGR NoN has hosted multiple events to identify knowledge and resources gaps and to develop students and early-career professionals to catalyze work that mitigates transboundary groundwater depletion. The TGR NoN project team created the Transboundary Aquifers Research Landscape https://tinyurl.com/tgrlandscape using publicly available publication and author data to enable persons working on transboundary groundwater resilience to identify potential collaborators and perform network analyses to understand who is part of successfully connected research groups. The TGR NoN Member Directory allows members to list their current projects and willingness to collaborate. The TGR Seminar Series fills the gap of knowledge and tools between the water, social, data and systems science networks by educating the groups on the groundwater work of and methods used by each discipline. Students and early career professionals have the opportunity to develop their presentation skills in TGR-focused Collective Learning Meetings. In TGR interactive events, participants identified stakeholder groups, established research priorities and created systems maps to show the causal links between variables they deemed important to groundwater resilience.  

Follow up mechanisms:  We invite you to engage in the development of the Network of Networks and Action Framework. Specific engagement tools include websites, conferences, workshops, international organization meetings and sessions.","This project for SDG implementation action develops critical innovative science and international collaborations with affected communities and local managers. Using transdisciplinary approaches that contribute knowledge from different social, economic, diplomatic and scientific perspectives is key for combating climate change and minimizing its impacts. The process of forming a network of networks (NoN) expands the foundation for this transdisciplinary approach across spatial scales to better understand why groundwater depletion occurs across regions and feasible approaches of aquifer recharge. This new action accelerates SDG implementation beyond other actions by using systems modeling and community-based approaches to identify important policies that promote the SDGs and include stakeholder input. By utilizing a holistic systems approach, the action addresses SDGs 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b, 13.3, 15.1 as well as many other climate change, natural resources, and community health SDGs. For example, similar to our argument that groundwater resilience requires a transboundary approach, we also posit that it requires a watershed-based approach, as aquifer recharge strategies often depend upon the resilience of several natural resource and management functions. Efforts to spread flood flows to recharge aquifers are hampered by the erosion occurring in uplands. Floods scour soils due to diminished vegetation resulting from depleted soil moisture and higher intensity storm events. The flows laden with soils, nutrients, and weed seed would create significant maintenance issues for farmers on their fields and the irrigation systems, and thus are rejected and opportunities for aquifer recharge are unavailable. The experts that are needed to develop solutions to these challenges are the actual land managers, including the ranchers on the uplands, the farmers in the valleys, and the managers of these systems. However, these managers do not use the same management tools, requiring the transdisciplinary development of collaborative tools. As well, the control of their management has regulatory and natural capacity limits, requiring innovative policy, technical support, and nature based solutions. The ultimate expected impact of this action is to develop this framework of a network of action, collecting success stories and sharing results across jurisdictional boundaries, and identifying the integrated needs of innovation in the governance of natural systems. This approach will outline a framework for sustainability of the network of networks after the end of the project cycle for healthy transboundary community and aquifer systems worldwide.","New Mexico Water Resources Research Institute

The Water Challenge builds public awareness and involvement in protecting water resources around the world by engaging citizens in three accessible steps:
Test – It all starts by understanding the state of water quality by using a simple test kit or probe
Share - Enter water quality data online through an international database allows those upstream and downstream to become part of the solution for clean water and healthy waterways worldwide.
Protect – Armed with an understanding of local water health and potential threats, young people use the information to take action and protect the vital water resources in their community
Protecting the quality of surface water in our local watersheds is a critical part of ensuring the overall health of the environment and water as an accessible resources for life.","As part of EarthEcho's mission to building a global youth movement to protect and restore our ocean planet, uplifting the work of 100 young leaders to improve their local surface water resources will result in both improved ecosystem health and water quality in the locations where youth projects are implemented. In coastal areas, where EarthEcho has a large following, a reduction in land-based pollution into marine ecosystems would also be anticipated.

At least 2 billion people use a water source that is contaminated with faeces (WHO, 2022). Safe drinking water with water kiosks or piped systems cost at least $25 per capita for CapEx so reaching  2 billion people with these options would cost at least $50 billion. A much cheaper, be it intermediate, solution that makes water that people drink safe is HWTS as promoted by the WHO and UNICEF.  Our initiative will share three decades of experience on both failures and success with HWTS and present “2 with 8”, a game changing approach to reach 2 billion people with HWTS at a cost of $8 billion. This idea was formulated at the 2022 Stockholm Water Week by a group of people guided by John Cherry, recipient of the 2020 Stockholm water prize. 

HWTS 
HWTS options include boiling, chlorine, UV and water filters. Over 80 HWTS products are documented by the organisation CAWST. (CAWST, 2021). The WHO tested products and over 30 comply with performance criteria for removal of turbidity and pathogens (WHO, 2022). Each option has its limitations. Boling cost fuel, Chlorine is eliminates bacteria and viruses but not cryptosporidium, a significant cause of child mortality. It also has a taste if not dosed exactly right. UV does not function with turbidity. Filters are expensive. However in Europe, America and Asia the filter market is booming and a proof that filters are market-based so a product that families are willing to pay for. Besides “inline filters” for piped  systems there is a range of table top gravity filters that are attractive, effective and affordable with prices of $20 to $60 and filter capacity of 30 - 100 ltrs/day. Some models also remove viruses. If filters comply with the 3 Cs, (Correct, Consistent, Continuous use) and if combined with improved hygiene, they are very effective in reducing water borne diseases. (Wolf. 2018). 

LESSONS LEARNED  
Many HWTS projects failed. For instance in East Africa 900.000 filters were given for free but after some time most filters were not used anymore (IRC, 2011). Reasons include complicated maintenance and as a free gift there was limited ownership by the users. However increasingly there are successes. For example, in Ethiopia a local assembly of several models of household water filters started. High quality filter elements are imported and the plastic containers are produced locally. Cost of the cheapest model is $22 and over 300.000 were sold. NGOs give filters to poor families but also many families pay the full price. Interesting in Ethiopia is that a growing number of water utilities accept that they cannot always deliver safe water e.g. due to power cuts, so families have to store water. As an additional service these utilities now sell filters to customers and others (Foppen. 2019).  The local production and actions with utilities were funded with aid money.","2 WITH 8
The expected impact of presenting the idea “2 with 8” is to stimulate action! To show with evidence that with a 1 time grant of around $4 per person, a large part of the SDG.1 target group can have  drinking water that is free from biological contamination and protozoa. In case of chemicals like Arsenic or fluor, an option is to collect rainwater just for drinking and use a filter. 
Actions needed to reach 2 billion people include:
1. Awareness creation            
    Awareness that clear water can still be contaminated, that safe water reduces health related cost, or that a water filter can be paid with the cost of 6 months of bottled 
   water. Awareness needs to be nationwide and for 3 to 5 years on radio, television, social media. An example of such a campaign was in Cambodia. (IDE, 2018)
2. Supply chains 
   In each town there should be shops that sell 3 or more options, so people have a choice. Products  should be government approved, comply with the 3Cs and be market- 
   based meaning that supply goes on without NGO or other support. 
3. Payment systems 
    Micro credit, pay as you use, group credit. An example can be the Grameen bank 
4. Subsidies for the poor
    An estimated 1 billion people part of the target group of SDG6.1, are so poor that they need support. To avoid market distortion vouchers can be applied. With a voucher 
    of for instance $20 a family goes to the local shop, pay $3 and get a filter worth $23. If they want a filter that cost $33, they pay $13. 

Households can be divided in those who: 
A. can afford upfront payment
B. need payment in instalments 
C. cannot pay the full price.  
Subsidizing the bottom billion is expected to create a commercial supply chain of filters for group A and B and a supply chain for spare parts for all groups.

ORGANISATION
Realization requires cooperation of Governments, Private sector, NGOs and the Finance sector. 
No single HWTS business can meet the needs of all these people so the producers of HWTS products could form an alliance similar to the solar light or cookstoves industry to build a dynamic, inclusive, and financially sustainable HWTS industry.

FUNDS 
Funds needed to reach 2 billion people is an estimated $8 billion of which some $2 bln. is for awareness, $1 bln. for supply chains and $5 bln. for vouchers. (200 mln. filters @ $25/filter).                                                                   
Funds could, should? come from parties interested in SDG6.1 and/ or SDGs for health (eg. stunting). 
A promising (partial) funding source are carbon credits which can be used for awareness creation or supply chain development and in some cases to lower the retail price of a filter.  The $8 billion can come from many donors. Governments and NGOs can start small with a village, later a region and if effective scale up to country level.","Nazava. Basic Water Needs.

Brazil (CGEE), Syrian Arab Republic, Global Action Plan, Togo, Uganda, Yemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe",Global,"The Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC) is a partnership of more than 50 institutions, including NGOs, academic institutions, and UN agencies. These partners offer limitless support to global actors in cholera control and prevention, including provisions of technical assistance, communications and advocacy support, political will-building, etc. The partners of the GTFCC cosigned a 2017 commitment to end cholera via creation of Ending Cholera – A Global Roadmap to 2030. These partners also recommitted to the GTFCC in mid-2022, reconfirming their ongoing involvement in the partnership.

The GTFCC offers countries the capacity, tools, and assistance to develop National Cholera Plans (NCPs) and implement them effectively, including: i) technical support and assistance; ii) partnership at local and global levels; iii) policy guidance; iv) capacity building; v) implementation of research; vi) advocacy and communications support; and vi) fundraising and resource mobilization. Additionally, the GTFCC’s operational arm – the Country Support Platform (CSP) – provides four countries (Bangladesh, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Nigeria, Zambia) with additional support and expertise mechanisms. The CSP is currently hosted by IFRC, and expansion to additional countries is a future possibility.

Oversight to the GTFCC is provided by a Steering Committee, which is comprised of several partner representatives that support the secretariat in making decisions and providing strategic direction. In addition, pillar-specific areas of cholera control and prevention activities have freestanding working groups to provide tailored assistance and support on a range of issues. Working group areas include oral cholera vaccines; water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); case management; and surveillance. 

The GTFCC also convenes an Advocacy Task Team, made up of key staffers from across a range of partners. The Advocacy Task Team holds responsibility over strategic thinking, convening, and dissemination of GTFCC advocacy and communications tools, which is achieved via a partnership-wide work plan.","The GTFCC partnership called for a commitment from all stakeholders to support cholera-affected countries and align energies, efforts, and resources to end cholera transmission. The partnership affirms the vision of a world in which cholera no longer presents a threat to public health, under the auspices of Ending Cholera: A Global Roadmap to 2030. Partners are committed to achieving a target of a 90% reduction in cholera deaths by 2030.

Controlling cholera is both a moral obligation and a critical step in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which call for the reduction of inequality, good health and wellbeing for all, and access to safe water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH). By addressing cholera, the world’s most marginalized individuals are immediately targeted, and by utilizing the GTFCC’s multidisciplinary partnership model, linkages are inherent to all activities.

The global roadmap is being implemented across three strategic axes, all of which offer far-reaching impact, both to achievement of the SDGs and beyond:
1) Early detection and quick response to contain outbreaks. (The roadmap focuses on containing outbreaks—wherever they may occur— through early detection and rapid response, which are critical elements for reducing the global burden of cholera. Through interventions like robust community engagement, strengthening early warning surveillance and laboratory capacities, health systems and supply readiness, and establishing rapid response teams, the number of deaths from cholera can be drastically reduced.)
2) A targeted multi-sectoral approach to prevent cholera recurrence. (The roadmap also calls on countries and partners to focus on cholera “hotspots,” the relatively small areas most heavily affected by cholera, which experience cases on an ongoing or seasonal basis and play an important role in the spread of cholera to other regions and areas. Cholera transmission can be stopped in these areas through measures including improved WASH and through use of OCV. In Africa alone, 40 to 80 million people live in cholera hotspots.)
3) An effective mechanism of coordination for technical support, advocacy, resource mobilization, and partnership at local and global levels. (The GTFCC provides a strong framework to support countries in intensifying efforts to control cholera, building upon country-led cross-sectoral cholera control programs, and supporting them through human, technical, and financial resources. As a global network of organizations, the GTFCC is positioned to bring together partners from across all sectors and offers an effective country-driven platform to support advocacy and communications, fundraising, intersectoral coordination, and technical assistance.

It generates data and intelligence and supports the development and dissemination of innovative, sustainable solutions for islands involving and creating value for local communities. GTI offers complete support to island strategies for a sustainable transition: facilitates project origination identifying innovative solutions, develops business models, monitors funding opportunities, builds capacities, disseminates good practices, and aggregates key island stakeholders. At its core, it’s the GTI Observatory, a think tank established to analyze islands' needs and match those with sustainable solutions through the application of the unique GTI Observatory Global Index, produce reports and studies, foster public-private cooperation, and promote innovative projects in the islands. With a focus on the integration of technology, policy and finance, the GTI Observatory brings together local, regional and national governments, institutions, utilities, innovation providers, investors, industry associations, academia and media, and its services include islands assessment and certification, technical support and training, good practices dissemination to accelerate islands sustainable journey.","The GTI Observatory leads to common solutions within the islands sector, both from the point of view of the islands and of solution providers, and contributes to progress towards a broad range of UN SDGs on islands. 
The GTI Observatory engages global leaders of the sustainable transition in multiple events and island summits, as well as in national, regional and international tenders for innovative island projects to help islands advance their decarbonization and sustainability journey. Strategic partnerships with key actors of global technology, policy and finance, as well as agreements with island governments and tenders with international funders are already in place in four main macro-regions: the EU and Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Asia Pacific, and the Caribbean. 
Through a new powerful digital platform -- currently under development -- the GTI Observatory will offer even more advanced services to islands worldwide. Islands with common challenges and necessities can set up buyer groups acquiring technological innovation, technical support, and consultancy with lower expenses thanks to economies of scale. This will help increase the bankability of island projects resulting in broader access to funding and accelerated sustainable transition. Furthermore, thanks to islands clustering through the GTI Observatory global Index and the new platform, corporates can identify multiple islands where to activate the same set of solutions thus increasing their interest in the island market, optimizing their effort and opening more development and business opportunities.","Instituto Tecnologico de Canarias

The campaign has existed since 2014, and every year it expands its geography. Within 9 years it has come to be rightfully considered as the largest ecological initiative in Russia: it has brought together over 8 million people, who has cleaned up 10,300 water bodies and has collected 9 million bags of garbage. Participants are volunteers who, in their free time from work and study are engaged in shore-line clean-ups.

The rationale is as follows. 
1) Utilities are the only institutions capable of delivering SDG 6 at scale. Utiilities therefore have to be at the heart of any proposal to accelerate the delivery of SDG 6 before the 2030 deadline. 
2) The main reason why utilities are not delivering SDG 6 is because they are not considered bankable. The funding is available but the performance of the utilities is often so weak that donors and lenders do not want to fund them. Instead the vast majority of funding goes to a tiny minority of high performance utilities. 
3) The key to achieving SDG 6 is therefore to transform the performance of the utility sector so that it becomes more bankable. 
4) The 300 Group is a peer-to-peer performance improvement network that brings utility leaders together to help each other and to take part in DFI designed programmes such aGIZ/KfW's Urban Water Catalyst Fund, the IFC's Utilities for Climate initiative and the World Bank's Utility of the Future programme.","A peer to peer performance improvement programmes act as both a motivator for leadership, a source of trusted technical assistance and an incubator for utilities seeking to participate in DFI sponsored programmes.",300 utilities in the global south.,Goal 6,"6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5","Tue, 05/09/2023 - 12:00","Fri, 01/01/2027 - 12:00",,0.625,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.75,1.0,1.0

Termed ‘water stewardship’ AWS defines this process as “the use of water that is socially and culturally equitable, environmentally sustainable and economically beneficial, achieved through a stakeholder-inclusive process that includes both site- and catchment-based actions.”

The AWS Standard System emerged from dialogues between public, private and civil society organisations. Their aim was to create a mechanism for businesses who are major users of water to systematically act on the diverse water-related challenges encompassed within the sub-targets in SDG 6. The result is a water-focused sustainability standard (“the AWS Standard”), widely recognised as best practice for businesses to manage their own water use and to engage with wider catchment dynamics, bolstered by a verification and certification system which ensures credibility of actions, outcomes and claims.

The AWS Standard System is supported and activated through a multi-stakeholder membership-based collaboration. Members of AWS include transnational corporations and their supply chain partners, development agencies and banks, international NGOs, water experts and research bodies. Collectively the membership develops the processes embedded within the AWS Standard, using evidence from use to continually improve its effectiveness. 

Management and revisions of the AWS Standard System follow and adhere to the Assurance Code guidance and requirements laid down by ISEAL, the standard setting body for voluntary sustainability standards systems.

The AWS Standard System was developed with the support of government agencies including the Swiss development agency (SDC), the German development bank (DEG) and the Netherlands development bank (FMO). Champions of the AWS approach include major water-focused civil society organisations including WWF, WaterAid, The Nature Conservancy, IWMI and the Global Water Partnership. Implementers of the AWS Standard include world-leading businesses and their global supply chain partners, operating in diverse sectors including agriculture and fresh produce, food and beverage production, microelectronics hardware and data storage, apparel and textiles production.","The AWS Standard seeks five outcomes: improvements in water balance, water quality, water governance, protection of water-related ecosystems and WASH. These outcomes track against each of the sub-targets of SDG6.

Implementers of the standard are guided towards a catchment contextual understanding of the severity of challenges relating to water availability, water quality, water resource management and governance, ecosystem health and access to water, sanitation and hygiene. Buy understanding the local context and by building meaningful relationships with the communities and water managers, regulators and policy makers within the catchment which sites are based they are then guided towards creating meaningful plans which comprise actions against each water-related theme/outcome.

The standard requires implementers to validate these plans with local stakeholders and to consult with local stakeholders on the progress against plan objectives, adapting as necessary to achieve impact. Through independent third-party auditing the certification process provides assurance that these plans have been credibly implemented. This process provides validation that actions are meaningful, have been implemented successfully and so guards against ‘bluewash’. 

Certification also serves to set a marker within sectors that raises the bar on norms within a given sector. As leading companies within each sector adopt the AWS approach so does this create momentum within the sector for others to follow. 

Our ultimate intent is that credible, verifiable water stewardship becomes the normal way of doing business. In this way we can guide the private sector to make meaningful contributions to SDG 6 with claims of progress that can be trusted at a global level (by investors, policy makers, consumers) and at a catchment level (by communities, regulators and water managers).

At the time of writing over 500 operational sites around the world have either certified against the AWS Standard or have registered to certify in the coming months. Over 10,000 individuals have downloaded the AWS Standard for use. Our goal is that by 2030 adoption of the AWS Standard is the norm in several business sectors, creating a global network of tens of thousands of sites making meaningful, verifiable contributions to the sub-targets within SDG 6.","AWS is a multi-stakeholder membership partnership comprised of, at the time of writing, 175 organisations.

            A biodiversity strategy and action plan for the Yellow River basin in Henan Province prepared",People within the Yellow River Basin,China,Asia and Pacific,"The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is supporting the People's Republic of China (PRC) Government to strengthen the sustainable management of natural capital in the PRC’s second largest river basin. The Yellow River Ecological Corridor (YREC) Program was established in 2020 adopting an innovative ecosystem management approach for water resources management by considering a river basin as an ecological corridor. The program is being implemented with support from the following PRC Government agencies involved with resource management and economic development of the Yellow River Basin: (i) the Yellow River Conservancy Commission; (ii) Ministry of Ecology and Environment; (iii) Foreign Economic Cooperation Center, Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs; (iv) Ministry of Water Resources; National Development and Reform Commission; (v) National Forest and Grassland Administration; (vi) Nine provinces in the Yellow River basins;(vii) Chinese Academy of Science and other academic institutes; and (viii) private sectors and NGOs. Balancing economic growth and sustainable development in the Yellow River basin is a challenging task. This is underscored by the increasing frequency of natural calamities such as the July 2021 floods that displaced more than 1 million people in Zhengzhou, the capital of Henan Province. Exacerbated by climate change, such water-related disasters will likely continue threatening livelihoods in the basin over the coming decades. Overexploitation of natural resources, inadequate water supply and sanitation services, soil contamination, water pollution, and climate change impacts are only some of the risks affecting the basin’s health and its most vulnerable rural communities. A nature-positive approach can help address both biodiversity and climate emergencies. The preservation of nature has emerged as a critical pathway for transitioning to growing the economy in a more resilient and sustainable way. This means ensuring that nature is an integral component of investment and fiscal and socio-economic policy decisions. Such an approach must include actionable targets that recognize the centrality of nature to maintain and restore ecosystem services and biodiversity and increase the resilience of catchment communities. Against this background, the YREC builds on three key principles: (i) protect the basin’s fragile ecological environment, (ii) address the severe condition of the water resources (balancing use and preservation), and (iii) promote high-quality green development and sustainable livelihoods. The YREC includes a program of lending, non-lending and policy interventions across four main thematic areas, such as: (i) natural resources management and biodiversity conservation, (ii) climate-resilient smart agriculture, (iii) climate change mitigation and adaptation, and (iv) integrated urban-rural green development.","The Yellow River basin in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) is one of the longest, most unique and fragile rivers in the world. It is also an example of the urgent need for action to build climate resilience and strengthen natural resources management. Cross-cutting measures to support river management in the Yellow River basin provide lessons for other basins in the Asia-Pacific region. The basin covers nine provinces in the PRC, has a total population of 420 million people and is a global biodiversity hotspot to preserve. An ecological corridor is a clearly defined geographical space that is governed and managed over the long term to maintain or restore effective ecological connectivity among several natural zones, linking groups of species. Healthy ecological corridors generate a diversity of ecological functions and economic co-benefits such as supporting the hydrological and nutrient cycling; and improving biodiversity while enhancing food security, climate resilience, and disease resistance. As such, the ecological approach proposed by the YREC has key implications for achieving the sustainable goals (SDGs) and their linkages. As the focus is on human–environmental interactions through the physical connectivity at the river basin scale, the YREC program contributes mainly to 5 SGDs including: water, ecosystem services, flood risks, (SDG 6), energy (SDG 7), urbanization (SDG 11), climate actions (SDG 13) and biodiversity (SDG15).",To be confirmed and listed below,"Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 11, Goal 13, Goal 15",,"Thu, 10/01/2020 - 12:00",,,0.0,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05494505494505515

Around 55% of the world’s population lives in urban areas, a proportion that is expected to increase to 68% by 2050. Projections show that urbanization, the gradual shift in residence of the human population from rural to urban areas, combined with the overall growth of the world’s population could add another 2.5 billion people to urban areas by 2050, with close to 90% of this increase taking place in Asia and Africa, according to 2018 Revision of World Urbanization Prospects report (2018).

Many countries are experiencing rapid growth due to rural-to-urban migration will inevitably witness the prevalence of informal settlements or slums in and around large cities. With these developments, challenges of sanitation, wastewater and faecal sludge management place growing pressure on countries to invest in this infrastructure. A lack of clarity around mandate and responsibilities for urban sanitation as a public service continues to be a bottleneck to service improvements. 

The report intends to provide a global reference on sanitation, wastewater and faecal sludge management in cities and human settlements.  It provides a situation assessment of wastewater and faecal sludge management and monitoring represented by selected cities. Drawing from existing literature and primary data collection across 18 cities, the study has un-derlined the scale of the challenge in strengthening wastewater and faecal sludge manage-ment at the global level, while also demonstrating that many inspiring examples exist for cities and countries to follow. The report synthesises key conclusions and recommendations, with the way forward to bringing wastewater and faecal sludge management to the heart of urban development.

In addition, 5 case studies from Medellín and the Metropolitan Area of the Aburrá Valley (Colombia), Ouagadougou (Burkina Faso), Dhaka (Bangladesh) , Nakuru (Kenya), and Hanoi (Vietnam),  drawn within the 18 selected cities have been developed for different thematic areas including; sanitation data management, extending services to informal settlements, sanitation services, and wastewater management in megacities, while covering the institutional and regulatory aspects, implementing climate-resilient wastewater management systems including reuse and long-term planning and financing of citywide wastewater and sanitation services. 
The report targets national-level decision makers involved in urban development and urban sanitation, reginal and global actors, urban sanitation and urban development practitioners and researchers. 
The report demonstrates UN-Habitat’s commitment to support the International Decade for Action, “Water for Sustainable Development”, 2018-2028.

It, however, has been receiving less attention among water management practices or even ignored or managed off-site instead of source-control.

As people in the Monsoon region have traditionally suffered from droughts and floods each year, rainwater is either a blessing or a curse, depending on how they manage rainwater. They might also have cultivated site-specific wisdom to tackle climate issues, which should be learned and shared widely. Young people in particular, who are the leaders and owners of the world, must know how to survive unprecedented climate extremes while living in peace with friends and neighbors by gaining and sharing the wisdom of their ancestors. In this context, school is believed to be an ideal place to teach and learn creative ideas and spread knowledge to the community and society.

The objective of this initiative is to raise the awareness of schools and students in each country about the importance of rainwater through international activities. The friendship made among young students would lay the foundation for the resilience of not only world peace but also climate change combat. To this end, “Rain School” and “Rain School Network” are proposed here, as school is the best place to harvest rainwater for drinking, exchange wisdom, and transfer knowledge.

At Rain School, a Rain for Drinking system consists of the roof catchment area, gutter, first flush diverter, series of tanks, pump, and fountain is constructed, producing drinking water that meets National Drinking Water Quality Standards. The system is designed using a multiple-barrier concept and nature-based treatment method, supplying 0.5-1L of water to each student daily. Collected rainwater quality and quality, as well as rainfall amount, are closely monitored mostly by the students. Water usage is self-regulated to minimize water shortage during the dry season. Remote consultation is provided through installed cameras and weekly reports.

For innovative system maintenance and social promotion, a special group called BiTS (“Bi” means “rain” in Korean, “T” stands for “Teachers” and “S” for “Students”) is formed. This group takes part in various Beauty (art and cultural exchange), Technology (system monitoring), and Social activities. They decorate the system, look for local ancient wisdom about water, and make creative dances. They then share the gained knowledge with their family and community, other school members, and society. International conferences and contests among different Monsoon Rain Schools are organized, drawing the attention, interest, and willingness to join BiTS groups and the Rain School Network. 

Another innovative idea is the creation of a SkyWater Committee, which consists of all parties: the school authority, Parent Association, rainwater experts, and local authority. It decides on necessary financial assistance and activities to ensure the system’s safe and sustainable supply.

Rain Schools are now operating in Vietnam, Cambodia, and Vanuatu. Laos and Myanmar’s Rain Schools will start operation in 2023. The Rain School Network in Monsoon will soon expand to other regions, such as South Asia (SARNET) and Africa.","Although rainwater has been used for drinking purpose throughout human history, it has been recently ignored due to technical challenges, such as poor quality of the harvested water, shortage during the dry season, and the lack of good models to follow. The proposed Rain School Initiative tackles these shortcomings in several ways.

First and foremost, schools and youth are the primary beneficiaries of this initiative. The installed Rainwater for Drinking (RFD) system provides good drinking water necessary for students, through which schools save money on purchasing costly purified water or overpriced fuel to boil water. Student health thus is improved (SDG3). Thanks to ensured water security, students no longer waste time fetching water from far away, giving them more adequate study and improving their education (SDG4).

Students also turn active in finding their own solutions to drinking water and climate change. They could influence their parents to change the prevalent misunderstanding surrounding rainwater, encouraging their families to make similar RFD systems at home and in the local community. Given the fact that most of the household water management is done by females, the system also contributes to gender equality, removing a heavy burden on women and girls (SDG5). After growing up and reaching all walks of life, they would spread these ideas to unlock the unlimited potential of rainwater. 

Moreover, through diverse activities at schools and international networks, students understand and appreciate the wisdom of neighboring countries and make friends with peers from different nations and ethnic groups. Starting from the Monsoon region, this Rain School Network will expand to other countries, especially those suffering from the recent climate crisis (SDG13). As the ultimate result of this initiative is the creation of an International Rain School Network, it emphasizes and strengthens the global partnership for sustainable development (SDG 17).

When the Ministry of Education acknowledges the importance of rainwater and Rain School activities, they would devote effort to providing rainwater systems for all schools, even including it in the curriculum. Donors and international agencies then join hands, magnifying the Rain Schools in the world. This brand-new type of “micro-local ODA” outweighs the existing macro ODA in all aspects.

In addition, when people recognize that roof-harvested rainwater is a good source of drinking water with proper design and maintenance, that RFD system is constructed using local materials and labor and sustainably maintained by local governance with a strong sense of ownership, it would expand to the whole society where the school belongs. This Rain School Initiative, therefore, serves as a game changer in achieving SDG 6.1.

Last but not least, by taking advantage of rainwater – a free, precious and unlimited water resource that has often been called as “free gift from the sky” – this initiative also provides a brand-new approach to “Justice for All.” It certainly will trigger an advanced water management paradigm of “Managing All Water, by All, for All,” which helps promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development (SDG 16).","Rain For All

As a global conservation leader, we are deeply committed to protecting and restoring the planet’s fragile freshwater systems. Globally, monitored freshwater populations have declined by an average of 83% since 1970, we’ve lost 64% of the world’s wetlands since 1900, and only 37% of the world's longest rivers remain unimpeded and free-flowing. Going forward, these systems are also most likely to experience the impacts of climate change, with patterns of precipitation becoming more unpredictable and regionally drier and wetter, exacerbating preexisting patterns of water abundance and insecurity. In response to this urgency, The Nature Conservancy commits to conserving 1 million kilometers of rivers and 30 million hectares of lakes and wetlands benefiting tens of millions of people by 2030. To deliver on this commitment, we will invest $250 million over the next seven years in partnership with the public and private sector through projects around the world.","The Nature Conservancy’s commitment and investment relates most directly to Sustainable Development Goals 15 (protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat desertification, and halt and reverse land degradation and halt biodiversity loss) and more specifically 15.1 which relates to inland waters (by 2020, ensure the conservation, restoration and sustainable use of terrestrial and inland freshwater ecosystems and their services, in particular forests, wetlands, mountains and drylands, in line with obligations under international agreements), 6 (ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all), and to a lesser extent  9 (build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation). We need water for people and water for nature, though for too long, we’ve viewed our rivers, lakes and wetlands as an unlimited source of water for development. The result has been devastating for the world’s freshwater ecosystems. We can do better by advancing nature-based solutions alongside novel protection and restoration efforts that combine policy, governance, protection, and restoration to safeguard inland waters. Together, we stand a better chance of bending the curve of freshwater biodiversity and ecosystem loss. We need healthy freshwater ecosystems for today’s needs and tomorrow’s generations too. Freshwater ecosystems can also help us become more resilient to climate change by providing places for floodwaters to settle, thereby reducing risk to people, and spaces for fish and other species to move to when conditions change, while helping 100 million people at severe risk of climate-related emergencies. For solutions to be truly durable, they must also address challenges at the intersection of water and equity which requires inclusive and collaborative approaches to engagement, decision-making, and governance.","Public sector, private sector, civil society, local communities","Goal 6, Goal 9, Goal 15",15.1,"Sun, 01/01/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 12/31/2030 - 12:00","The Nature Conservancy’s 2030 commitments, including freshwater, can be found here: https://www.nature.org/en-us/what-we-do/our-priorities/",0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

This requires ‘joined-up’ action for collective outcomes by the humanitarian, development, and peace actors, and effective leadership and coordination plays a central role. The Global WASH Cluster, leading the largest humanitarian WASH multi-stakeholder platform, commits to deliver on collective outcomes for the Water Decade Action Plan within and beyond the WASH sector. The business-as-usual approach is not delivering the results needed and requires a “new way of working” that fosters partnership and increases collaboration across humanitarian, development and peace actors. Humanitarian assistance, development cooperation and peacebuilding are not siloed processes and should be layered and coordinated, at the same time, to reduce needs, risks and vulnerabilities. Collaboration that leads to collective outcomes, optimizes the principles of partnership and harnesses the comparative advantage of a diverse range of actors.

This can be achieved through joint context and risk analysis, complementary planning and programming, and a recalibration of financing modalities. System-wide change Collective outcomes are the most effective framework for closer collaboration across humanitarian, development and peace actors, in accordance with respective mandates. These set a concrete and measurable result that promote synergy and complementarity and is an approach that calls for aligned and well-coordinated action by all actors. Effective leadership and coordination play a central role in attaining collective outcomes.

The UN coordination architecture that guides humanitarian action and development cooperation is the entry point for strengthening existing country-level processes and lays the foundation for system-wide change. Incorporating pathways that link the strategic direction of national priorities and plans, such as the Humanitarian Needs Overview (HNO) and Humanitarian Response Plans (HRPs) to the Common Country Analysis (CCA) and the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is vital. Multi-stakeholder platforms, such as the Global WASH Cluster (GWC), are best positioned to drive a consistent and coherent approach for the articulation and agreement of collective outcomes across for the WASH sector. Coordination is a catalyse for ensuring that CCA and UNSDCF processes to define collective outcomes are rooted in analysis of HNOs and are complementary to HRPs. These efforts will address missed opportunities for alignment and promote the added value of “joined up” action, optimizing existing frameworks and increasing accountability of the coordination mechanism in place. Through a renewed commitment to effective and accountable coordination, the GWC, are a leading voice to advocate for and drive thought leadership on collective outcomes to influence policy change within and beyond the WASH sector.","Strengthening collective action and advocating for, within and beyond the WASH sector to consistently provide timely, predictable, and high-quality water and sanitation outcomes by providing thought leadership and spearheading the coordination will be at the heart of these following actions:

1) Promoting joint analysis or sharing of analyses to obtain a shared understanding of need, risk and vulnerability and the optimization of relevant data and information to understand gaps and make evidence-based decisions to accelerate progress towards SDG6.

2) Incorporating pathways that link the strategic direction of national priorities across humanitarian and development planning processes, including HNOs and HRPs to the CCA and the UNSDCF; and calling for the recalibration of financing mechanisms to support humanitarian and development priorities as defined by collective outcomes. This will catalyze efficiencies between humanitarian and development actors in WASH and improve progress on SDGs subsequently.

3) Advocating for innovative partnerships and coordination of an integrated humanitarian-development-peace nexus approach through “joined up” action and collective outcomes.

4) Contributing to creating a professional and motivated workforce with expertise in coordination that drives innovative and transformative WASH outcomes across humanitarian action, development cooperation and peacebuilding will ensure a more coherent capacity to accelerate progress SDG6.","88 members and 2 standing observers

- strengthen the links between the water and nature communities to enable effective policies and practices,

- promote the use of Nature-based Solutions by water practitioners,

- stimulate global and political momentum for the financing and implementation of Nature-based solutions.

 

Its target audiences are:

- Professional and user communities of water and nature who should strengthen their dialogue and design integrated projects and initiatives and play their role in conservation.

- Political and economic decision makers at global, national, local and basin levels.

The Declaration calls its signatories to action, including to companies that commit to carry out actions to restore natural resources and ecosystems, contributing to sustainable development, in line with the SDGs, adopting a pro-nature attitude, will be welcome.

The Steering Committee of the “Water and Nature” Declaration (WWC, TNC, OiEau, INBO) is in charge of its governance and of the follow-up regarding the commitments made.","There is a need for a greater recognition of the strong inter-linkages between water resources and natural systems, and this needs to be translated into more consistent public policies. Equally, there is a need for concrete actions, on the ground, that materialize this recognition. This might be done by an acceleration in the implementation of Nature-based solutions in the water sector. The “Water and Nature” Declaration is set to mobilize political support for this message.

The Declaration aims to receive the support of up to 150 signatory organizations from 50 countries, with a call for action to implement and fund projects in line with the definition of Nature-based Solutions (NbS), namely: “actions to protect, conserve, restore, sustainably use and manage natural or modified terrestrial, freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems which address social, economic and environmental challenges effectively and adaptively, while simultaneously providing human well-being, ecosystem services, resilience and biodiversity benefits.” (see UNEA Resolution No.5 adopted on March 2nd, 2022).

The rationale of the declaration is that there is “no water security without ecological security, and no ecological security without water security”. In other words, it recognizes and emphasizes the strong interlinkages between water and ecosystems, and hence the fact that SDG 6 on Water and the Biodiversity SDGs (14 for marine ecosystems & 15 for terrestrial ecosystems) are tightly intertwined.

The Commitment also aligns with the historic outcome of the Biodiversity COP 15 that took place in Montreal in December 2022 and during which Nations adopted the “Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework” (GBF), a package of measures critical to addressing the dangerous loss of biodiversity and restoring natural ecosystems, including four goals and 23 targets for achievement by 2030. These goals include the “the effective conservation and management of at least 30% of the world’s inland waters” and to “have restoration completed or underway on at least 30% of degraded inland waters” by 2030. Target 11 aims to “Restore, maintain and enhance nature’s contributions to people, including ecosystem functions and services, such as regulation of air, water, and climate, soil health, pollination and reduction of disease risk, as well as protection from natural hazards and disasters, through Nature-based solutions and ecosystem-based approaches for the benefit of all people and nature.” Moreover, the purpose of Target 19 is to “Substantially and progressively increase the level of financial resources from all sources, in an effective, timely and easily accessible manner, including domestic, international, public and private resources (…) by 2030 mobilizing at least 200 billion US dollars per year”, including by leveraging private finance, promoting blended finance, implementing strategies for raising new and additional resources, and encouraging the private sector to invest in biodiversity, notably through impact funds and other instruments.

The expected result from the implementation of the projects focusing on Nature-based Solutions is the achievement of both water security and ecological security, with, as an outcome, a more sustainable use of natural resources, in particular freshwater- and related ecosystems.","The Nature Conservancy (TNC)

Indirect: households & communities where SMARTechs are installed, with a focus on farming families with water for domestic and productive uses. WASH networks where resources are shared (such as RWSN).","Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Malawi, Mozambique, Nicaragua, Nigeria, South Sudan, Global Action Plan, Ibero-American Network of Life Cycle Assesment, United States of America, Zambia",Africa,"The SMART approach. The approach to reach the targets mentioned above is the SMART approach SMART stands for Simple, Market-based, Affordable, and Repairable Technologies and examples include household water filters, manually drilled tube wells, locally produced hand and solar pumps, rainwater harvesting and underground storage tanks. The combination of innovative technologies, the local production of drill sets and pumps and the focus on smaller wells for small communities can reduce the investment cost (CapEx) of an improved water source to as low as $25/person, provided the annual rainfall is >200mm. In this way it is possible to reach the many rural areas in SSA where population density is less than 50 people per square km. To provide “basic service” in these areas with conventional technologies like machine drilled boreholes and imported pumps, would cost $50-$150 per person. So reaching SDG6.1 in these rural areas with the SMART approach is possible at a much lower cost than with the conventional approach (Sutton. 2021). The SMART approach includes: 1. Innovation. New technologies for house hold water treatment, wells, pumps, rainwater harvesting and storage. All options that can be produced locally. 2. Training. Building capacity of the local private sector in technical & business skills 3. Self-supply. Stimulate households to invest in their own well. For instance subsidizing farm wells that are used for both domestic and productive uses like irrigation instead of subsidizing communal wells which are just for domestic use. SMARTechs Early examples of SMARTechs are the EMAS pump in Bolivia and the rope pump in Nicaragua. Both started around 1990 and over 70.000 of each pump type were installed in these countries. In Africa the introduction of SMARTechs started around 2000. Although simple, the hard lesson learned is ”Simple is not easy”. Good quality technologies require long term coaching in both technical and business skills.","Reach SDG 6.1 in rural SSA by subsidizing farm wells and storage tanks. At several water fora professor John Cherry, recipient of the 2020 Stockholm Water Prize, highlighted the need for tens of millions of small wells in SSA. Small wells for farm families for domestic use that also serve to produce food in dry period (Cherry, 2022). Some 400 million people in SSA do not have “safely managed” or “basic water service”, the target group of SDG 6.1. Some 80% of these, so 320 million people, live in rural areas and are mostly small holder farmers with plots of 0.5 to 5 Ha. In many areas manual drilling of low cost tube wells is possible. Where wells are too expensive rain water can be collected in underground tanks. These combined with good quality water filters provide “basic service” or “safely managed water service” The average cost to provide water with improved of “new” locally produced technologies (SMARTechs) is 25$/ person so, the cost to reach SDG 6.1 in rural SSA would be 320 x $25 = $ 8 billion. This is 2 to 6 times less than what would be needed in the same situation with imported technologies (Sutton, 2021) or what would be needed according to the WHO (WHO, 2022). Besides reaching SDG 6.1 other advantages of this approach include contributions to; • SDG 1. Poverty. Water for livestock and irrigation can generate income • SDG 2. Food. Farm wells can be used to grow food in dry periods. • SDG 3. Gender. A household well reduces the time now used to collect water. • SDG 8. Employment. Wells and pumps create jobs for drillers and metal workers. • SDG 13. Climate. Rain water storage and low-cost wells build climate resilience. Through the partnership the three organisations will share their available resources, training manuals, experiences and lessons learned, network and M&E methodology.

https://hlpf.un.org/2022/programme/improving-global-partnerships-for-ed…",India,Global,"The Women’s Health and Education Center (WHEC) promotes a One Health approach as part of agrifood system transformation for the health of people, animals, plants and environment. This involves a spectrum of actors and work on sustainable agriculture, animal, plant and forest, and aquaculture health, food safety, antimicrobial resistance (AMR), food security, nutrition and livelihoods. Ensuring a One Health approach is essential for progress to anticipate, prevent, detect and control diseases that spread between animals and humans, tackle AMR, ensure food safety, prevent enforcement-related human and health threats, as well as combating many other challenges. A One Health approach is also critical for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). 

Our Role: WHEC works with partners and UN System, to promote health systematically, and focuses on eliminating hunger, promoting food security, food safety, and healthy diets, preventing and controlling transboundary diseases, zoonoses, and AMR, to protect the livelihoods of farmers from the impacts of plant and animal diseases, and to increase the sustainability and resilience of agrifood systems, with One Health benefits.

We are one world working together for One Health! 

WHEC supports its partners and Member States to build and implement effective collaborative One Health Strategies and capacities, simultaneously and addressing the health of people, animals, plants and the environment. Its approach is used to design and implement programs, biosecurity initiatives, enabling policies, and where relevant, regulatory frameworks to ensure health security from communities to national and international level. Good One Health planning, communication, collaboration and response efforts occur when government officials, researchers and workers across sectors at the local, national, regional and global levels join forces.","Women's Health and Education Center's (WHEC’s) publications are aimed at a broad range of audience, and it is hoped the everyone who reads this comes away with a realization of the complexity of the issues at stake and an appreciation of the work that lay in front of us. 

Studies of microbiology, toxicology, chemistry, epidemiology, biology, genetics and many other scientific disciplines provide evidence of food safety hazards and their risks, and help select ways (policies, standards, practices) to manage them. Climate change is increasing the risk of consumer exposure to foodborne hazards, whether from land or sea. The changes in climate have a direct impact on biological (pathogens and parasites) and chemical (heavy metals, pesticides, mycotoxins and algal biotoxins) hazards by changing their occurrence, distribution or virulence. 

Climate change is also affecting the quality of water globally by exacerbating conditions that lead to algal blooms, which are worsening along coastlines and in lakes. An overabundance of fertilizer application combined with more frequent and intense precipitation are among the factors leading to increased eutrophication in waterbodies and algal blooms. 

National authorities, scientists and the research community have the responsibility of engaging in effective communication with the public in order to foster an environment where people make more climate-sensitive decisions based on the best available knowledge about climate change. 

Everyone who produces, processes, transports, stores, prepares, serves and consumes food needs use practices that keep foods safe – everyone ensures food safety. Governments play a key role in developing legislation, implementing policies, conducting inspections, enforcing regulations, educating and communicating with the public, as well as responding to food safety incidents and emergencies when they happen. As the slogan of World Food Safety Day goes, “Food safety is everyone’s business.”

Safe food requires managing risk from farm to table. Food can become unsafe at any point in the supply chain. Contaminants may enter food commodities from the soil, water, air or equipment used during production and processing. Storing food improperly, unhygienic handling of food and transporting it at the wrong temperature can make it unsafe to eat. The consumer can also make food unsafe by not cooking it thoroughly. The SDGs call for everyone, in particular the poor and vulnerable, to have access to safe, nutritious, and sufficient food all year round. Food safety isa fundamental part of food security (SDG 2) and contributes to human health (SDG 3). Food safety also contributes to economy-related and other Goals, too. One Health is an integrated approach for preventing and mitigating health threats at the animal-human-plant-environment interfaces. Food safety has a significant impact on human health, and food, which is essential for human survival, comes from plants and animals. food safety is a core tenet of One Health.","World Health Organization (WHO)

However, there has so far been limited discussion with solutions that address the root cause of water inequity, injustice, disempowerment, and the resulting trauma faced by entire BIPOC communities and marginalized individuals across communities. 
By recognizing the role of history and the international development paradigm in creating inequitable access to and pollution of water resources, our goal is to provide ongoing experiential practice, education, engagement, and action that  
-‘decolonize’ water access, restore water rights and connections, and leverage traditional and cultural knowledge on protection of water resources
-apply ongoing research and evidence-based trauma-sensitive practices that center water as a catalyst for healing collective trauma, mental health and physical health challenges that arise due to exposure to contaminated water
-increase water and climate justice for women, indigenous, and black and brown communities. 
-promote social and economic empowerment and employment of women, youth, indigenous and black and brown communities in water-related industries.
Our implementation is through community partnership events and programs such as:
-film screenings on the history of water and racism, and the culture of healing people who heal the planet 
-nature-based workshops and retreats that focus on human wellbeing and planet wellbeing, and promote commitments and pledges to water and climate action
-regular BIPOC ""water is our medicine"" community of practice groups practicing evidence-based water-centered mindfulness near waterways
-mindful beach clean up for healing justice and action bi-annual volunteer event
-supporting partners offering Women and BIPOC water safety education and lifeguard training and job placement programs (DIA)
-supporting local government actions and proposed legislation on the right to clean water in South Florida
-best practice sharing in cross community convenings within the Southeast Climate and Energy Network","Our partnership activities at the local and regional level will increase awareness and engagement among women, BIPOC and youth in protecting waterways and promoting sustainable development, and improve their overall physical and mental health. 
Our partnering organization programs will increase the number of BIPOC and female trained lifeguards which can in turn increase water safety.

            Mobilization of CTA signatories so they can, based to their resources, set up an enabling environment, by mobilizing their partners and positioning themselves on the 5 points of the CTA","Populations living in Fragile, Conflict and Violent settings",Switzerland,Global,"In order to achieve the SDG6, it is essential not to forget populations living in Fragile, Conflict and Violent settings (FCV), which represent 23% of the world's population (OECD). 

The past decade has seen an unprecedented frequency and density of humanitarian interventions. In 2021, HIIK's Conflict Barometer counted 355 conflicts worldwide, nearly three times as many as in the 1990s. In addition to being more numerous, crises are also becoming more complex: humanitarian organizations face a wide range of crisis, from those triggered by environmental or climatic factors, to protracted conflict-related crises, with aggravating factors such as migration, urbanization and climate change. 

Currently, humanitarian WASH actors do not have capacity and resources to respond to the ever growing-needs and demands. Indeed, humanitarian funds dedicated to the WASH sector represented only 21% of the amount requested during Humanitarian Response Plans. This is particularly worrying when the total amount of people in need is increasing every year, from 80 million in 2013 to 339 million in 2023. In addition, according to the 2018 SOHS, barely half of humanitarian programs meet their objectives on time and with an acceptable level of quality. 

To tackle these gaps, over thirty of the world's most active actors in the humanitarian WASH sector -such as international NGOs, United Nations agencies, universities- have created a unprecedented collective to work collaboratively in order that by 2025, the humanitarian WASH sector will have the capacity and resources to deliver qualitative responses at scale, anywhere and anytime. Together, they developed and committed to implement the WASH Road Map (WRM), a set of 16 global initiatives organized in four working groups related to (i) better management of access to information and knowledge, (ii) capacity building and professionalization of humanitarian workers worldwide, (iii) strengthening inter-sectoral coordination and innovative partnerships, (iv) higher-level advocacy and resource mobilization. 

As part of the advocacy initiative, WRM actors have undertaken actions to urge governments to commit to take tangible actions to strengthen the WASH sector in FCV settings. Today, WRM actors are concerned by the lack of attention given to specific WASH challenges in FCV settings during past water high-level events and proceedings (e.g. 2022 Dakar declaration and 2021 High Level Political Forum).

They developed a Call to Action and strong substantial advocacy strategy for UN Member States to maximize its visibility and resonance. Advocacy actions include relentless communication on social networks to maximize the number of signatories (target 200 signatory organizations); facilitating external WRM actors to appropriate themselves CTA messages thanks to already-built visuals, social media messages, an email signature and a powerpoint slide; organizing internal and external side-events at the UN23WC, webinars, seminars; assuring a follow-up with signatories to inform them on the Water Action Agenda and to include them in future advocacy efforts, etc. The communication and dissemination actions of CTA will continue beyond the 2023 UN Water conference and a monitoring system of the commitments made by the States will be put in place until 2030.","The expected results of this call to action are as follows:

• That governments primarily focus their efforts towards those living in FCV settings. They are the most impacted by the multiple burdens of conflict, climate change, poverty, and hunger. A special focus should be given to countries with no evolution on the achievement of SDG6, and populations without even access to basic WASH services.

• That governments further support humanitarian WASH response and coordination to deliver predictable, effective (timely) and sufficient survival WASH responses and to ultimately safeguard the lives and health of those living in FCV contexts.

• That governments build sustainable and resilient WASH services that can withstand crises. Building back better and adapting existing systems, from infrastructures to communities, should be systematic especially in countries most exposed to multiple risks (climate crises, conflicts, natural disasters). In these contexts, collaboration between development and humanitarian actors at all levels from local to global will ensure continuity of services and better value for money. Together, let’s build services that last.

• That all governments actively promote the effective implementation of International Humanitarian Law obligations relevant to the protection of WASH personnel and UN Security Council Resolution 2573 (2021), including by promoting the identification and exchange of good practices in the protection of WASH infrastructure during armed conflict, supporting data collection on attacks on or impacting WASH infrastructures and their reverberating effects, and facilitating access to equipment, spare parts and consumables required to restore and maintain WASH services.

• That governments support the request to the UN General Secretary to nominate as soon as possible a UN Special Envoy for Water to establish a recurrent intergovernmental, UN-hosted, mechanism to discuss global water issues and to ensure the achievement of SDG 6 and all water- related SDGs

These requests will directly impact the acceleration of the SDG-6: It is only by including the most vulnerable that we can hope to reach the SDGs. Through these five demands, the Call to Action tackles the lack of international attention, mediatization, political means, resources, and capacities invested in FCV contexts and in the WASH sector. It is only by strengthening the latter, the main provider of water and sanitation services in crisis situations, that we will be able to claim to have done everything possible to achieve the universal goals of SDG6.

Furthermore, water affects all aspects of development, and the WASH sector is intrinsically linked to other SDG-sectors such as health, food security, gender equality, education, reducing inequality, peace etc. As a vital element, water feeds economic development and contributes to the health of human beings. History has shown that investing in safe water and sanitation averts preventable deaths and transforms lives. 

This explains why CTA actors are inviting actors from other sectors and contexts to participate to this inter-sectorial/multi-sectorial effort by signing the document and by appropriating themselves the information and content of the CTA to side-events around the UN 2023 Water Conference and other conferences, events, seminars etc.","All signatories.

Specifically, success will be measured in improved crop yields, income generation, the shift from subsistence farming to income generating farming and the resilience of farmers to drought. Success will also be measured in terms of the ability to scale up the intervention from local to regional levels. Success will also be measured in terms of the development and implementation of policies to promote the use of treated wastewater and to safely regulate its use. Improved environmental protection such as reduction of sewage flows into surface and groundwaters will also be measured.

The Network draws on the rich experience and expertise of its diverse members with inspiration from the Women, Peace, and Security Agenda and Women Mediation Networks – putting focus on women and youth empowerment, experience exchange and capacity building, research cooperation, and collective engagement at key basin, regional and global policy dialogues, as articulated in the Network’s 2022 Global Strategy – ‘A Path Forward for Women, Water, Peace and Security.’ The 2022 Women in Water Diplomacy Network Global Joint Statement: ‘A Rising Tide of support for women in water diplomacy’ is the foundation of a voluntary commitment to the Water Action Agenda on behalf of the Women in Water Diplomacy Network and its broad partnership. The commitments described in the ‘A Rising Tide’ Global Network Joint Statement were developed and endorsed by Women in Water Diplomacy Network members, the Network’s Leadership Council, and supporters representing formal and informal water decision makers engaged at the frontlines transboundary water governance in some of the most water insecure and conflict-sensitive basins and regions in the world. The Women in Water Diplomacy Network elevates a shared commitment to ‘discuss common challenges, share experience, enhance understanding of each other and our countries’ perspectives, build trust, and support one another to seek mutually beneficial opportunities for cooperation to achieve sustainable water for all.’ The Network’s Water Action Agenda Voluntary Commitment speaks to the strong linkages between women, water, peace and security and ‘the essential value of water to peace and human security.’ The Women in Water Diplomacy Network elevates a shared commitment to ‘discuss common challenges, share experience, enhance understanding of each other and our countries’ perspectives, build trust, and support one another to seek mutually beneficial opportunities for cooperation to achieve sustainable water for all.’ Specific commitments and calls to action in the ‘A Rising Tide’ Voluntary Commitment are addressed to young people, male colleagues and water sector peers, local, national, regional, global decision makers and development partners.","‘Women and children from vulnerable communities are bearing a heavy and disproportionate burden for unsustainable water management. Yet, women experts and decision makers are far from equally represented in transboundary water management decision making processes. While it has long been recognized that women play an essential role in both, the provision, management, and safeguarding of water resources, and all scales of development and peacebuilding processes, including conflict prevention, conflict resolution, and post-conflict reconstruction and recovery, rigid barriers restricting women’s equal participation and influence persist. The essential value of water to peace and human security spurs us to elevate our voices and knowledge in a global rising tide of water experts, peacemakers, mediators, and stewards. As leaders we know this to be true - sustainable water for all is foundational to a peaceful, secure, resilient shared-future and to the full and effective enjoyment of human rights. Many women water diplomats are currently at the innovative fore of efforts to advance cooperative and inclusive transboundary water governance solutions in some of the most vulnerable countries and communities around the world. As decision makers and experts, we, members and supporters of the Women in Water Diplomacy Network, stress the urgency of action needed to address our shared water and climate challenges and, we commit, in our capacity as water leaders, to continue to work together to further this cooperation. Through our collective strength and support to each other we affirm that a rising tide does, indeed, raise all.’ - Excerpt from Women in Water Diplomacy 2022 Global Joint Statement. As described in the above expert from the full text of the Women in Water Diplomacy Network’s 2022 Global Joint Statement, the Network commits to driving change towards achieving a variety of key targets and fostering linkages between key goals including SDG’s Goal 5 (gender equality), Goal 6 (sustainable water for all), Goal 16 (peace, justice and strong institutions), and Goal 17 (partnerships for the goals). Developed and supported by women water experts and diplomats in frontline water insecurity communities – the Network’s Global Joint Statement: ‘A Rising Tide of support for women in water diplomacy’ fosters collective positive movement for a peaceful and water secure future.","This Women in Water Diplomacy Network Voluntary Commitment was developed by the Network and its Leadership Council.

            National community water management strategies developed and validated.",The government,Cameroon,Africa,"The objective is to enhance the management of water, sources and channels through community led actions.

Approaches include
- Awareness raising of the dangers climate change, and role of water, and the need for effective management. This is done through sensitisation of community people, women and youth, as well as through conducting of environmental education in schools and communities using meetings, posters, flyers, image boxes, home education, focus group discussions, etc.
- Build capacities on water resources management. Training session will be at different levels targeting different sexes and classes of person in the communities.
- Setting up of multi-stakeholder/multi-actor water management and water security dialogue and governance scheme for communities (dialogue and management platform). This platform will redress human induced deforestation and forest degradation around water sources and in their communities. 
- Document and plan the customary land tenure underpinning water sources, courses of communities. Community participatory mapping, georeferencing and land use planning of their customary lands is conducted to ensure farming and other community activities are known and better planned taking into account the importance of protecting the landscape and water bodies. 
- Elaborate the Communal development plans for councils. The council being the lead of community development, the development plans will be developed taking into account sustainable management activities of the water bodies within the municipalities as well as the aspirations of the concerned communities.  
- Promote landscape and ecological restoration. Nurseries with native and water retention tree species will be set in communities and schools. The nurseries will be managed by community and school children. At maturity, the seedlings will be planted around watersheds, water catchments, along rivers and streams, and other degraded landscapes. Sacred and primary forests will equally be restored in order to contain their cultural values. Restoration, tree growing rates will equally be monitored regularly with the use of drones and direct field visits by project team. 
- Improved ecofriendly livelihood activities with communities. Best practices on Zero deforestation, climate friendly agriculture and fishery activities will be promoted at household levels in order to increase income levels.  
- Promote sharing of best practices and experience sharing. Community leaders, women, youth and young children will be offered opportunities to conduct exchange visits to share their experiences at national and international water related conferences that will enable learn from other shared lessons and thus, improve on their practices. After such meeting, they will conduct restitution sessions in their communities to raise awareness of best practices.
- Put in place an effective monitoring and evaluation system. Regular surveillance mechanism will be institutionalize at community levels to reduce poor water management practices. Sanctions and punitive measures will be agreed upon by the communities to be meted on defaulters.","- Knowledge and skills on water management is well assimilated and practiced in and by communities who leave close to water sources and courses. This is further repelled to other communities and countries during exchange programs and experience sharing sessions. 
- Water born diseases and related mortalities are reduced as a result of best water management practices put in place by communities and the councils.  
- Climate change effects, loss and damages, pollution, etc. are mitigated due to best practices carried out at community and council levels as effective restoration activities are effectively carried with well thought-out management plans put in place.
- With an efficient governance platform put in place, the management of water sources and course support the realisation of other SGD Goals such as Goal: 1, 3, 6, 13, 15

Area-based data, statistical data, water situation, forecasting, and water management-related research data from related agencies are integrated. All data are stored in the same database and available for exchange between agencies in order to maximize mutual benefits in managing water resources, analyzing and forecasting, disaster warning, minimizing life and property losses, supporting management in normal and crisis situations.
The development of NHC was started after the big flood in 1995 which cause severe losses to the country. In 1998 – 2002, Hydro-Informatics Institute (HII) was initiated to develop and integrate water information system from 5 government agencies in Thailand following His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s initiative that was an important starting point to accelerate the development and usage of information technology in water management in Thailand. 
In 2012, there is an initiative to create “National Hydroinformatics Data Center” (NHC) to integrate water and weather-reltaed information from 12 concerned agencies to integrated, exchange, and analyze information for national’s water management. At present, NHC network is expanded to integrate information from over 50 relevant agencies in Thailand to increase its efficiency to all.  
Thailand’s NHC is an open knowledge platform integrated information from partner agencies using “Big Data” to manage the massive amount of data and create Online Analytical Processing (OLAP) database in organizing a multidimensional perspective and enhancing its visualization speed. The result from this ThaiWater Big Data Platform is in the form of Application Programming Interface (APIs) will be analyzed in a complex manner with a multidimensional perspective. However, the visualization is displayed in an easy-to-understand format for public on www.thaiwater.net and ThaiWater Mobile Application. The highlight of NHC’s information system development is the usage of “Open Source” technology which requires continuous development, either on the system or the people side. 
The achievement of NHC, in crisis situation, HII is a part of “Operational support to the Special Water Resources Management Operation Center in Southern Thailand” to efficiently analyze and evaluate the hazard, which is the “Key” for planning and preparedness before flood situation. During normal situation, the provided information in NHC e.g., rain forecast, automated telemetry station, and water level in reservoir can be used to apply and transfer to local communities to create local water dataset for sustainable development and ensure the security of the economy, society, natural resource, and food.","- The exhibition is expected to inspire the development of collaboration among relevant agencies to perform good practices of sustainable water management by science, technology, and innovation in Thailand

Water runs as a common link through several of them, and the targets and indicators relating to freshwater systems are to be found not only in the dedicated water goal (goal 6) but also in other goals and indicators. Groundwater systems serve as a useful example to illustrate some of the interconnections. Local, regional and continental aquifers are strategically significant, constituting the planet's major storage reserve of freshwater and representing a critical buffer for socioeconomic adaptation to climate and environmental change. Threats to their sustainability, associated with both excessive exploitation and quality degradation over the past 30–50 years represent a potential impediment to achieving the SDGs—and this applies not only to the SDG-6 for water but also to SDG-2 on food security, SDG-3 on human health, SDG-11 on resilient cities, SDG-13, SDG-15 on protecting ecosystems and conserving biodiversity and SDG 17. SDGs relating to food production, resilient cities, and aquatic ecosystems can only be achieved in the long term if underlying groundwater systems are conserved in “good status” and not subject to continued depletion and quality degradation. The inter-linkages across the SDGs are many, and a full and systematic understanding of the links can offer an opportunity to formulate strategically policy interventions and solutions that simultaneously advance multiple goals. Furthermore, failure to achieve water-related goals propagates the risk of failure in achieving other interlinked goals. For instance, if we fulfill the clean water and sanitation (SDG-6) completely, it will significantly advance SDG-14 and 15 on preserving land and aquatic ecosystems respectively—and failure in achieving SDG-6 will negatively impact these connected SDGs. Thus, prioritizing the water targets could be one of the most important ways to maximize the potential stimulus of other SDGs. The interconnections between water, food, energy, land, and climate are been increasingly studied by researchers across multiple disciplines who recognize that understanding the important links is a necessary element for future sustainable development and as a response to global environmental change. The interconnections of water with agriculture (and food security and rural livelihoods), energy (particularly through hydropower but also with other energy systems), land (and ecosystems), public health (based on water quality and access), and sustainable cities and communities have long been highlighted. There has also been significant research on integrated water resources management (IWRM) that sought holistically to improve development and management of water sources. This action can serve as an important base to build toward further work in the context of the new SDGs for identifying and understanding their linkages for synergistic actions.","Central Government Ministries, Private sector, Academia, Media, UN Organizations","Goal 3, Goal 6, Goal 10, Goal 11, Goal 12, Goal 15, Goal 17","2.1 , 2.2, 3.1, 3.d, 6.1 , 6.2, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 10.2, 11.5, 11.6, 11.a, 12.2, 12.5, 12.8, 15.1, 15.3, 15.5, 15.a, 17.1, 17.6, 17.9, 17.14, 17.15, 17.16, 17.17","Wed, 02/01/2023 - 12:00","Tue, 04/30/2024 - 12:00",,0.875,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

Concernant l'implémentation du Parlement des Jeunes pour l'Eau Artois Picardie (PJE AP), elle répond à 4 dynamiques complémentaires : - Education aux enjeux liés à l’eau. Chaque session ordinaire du PJE AP est articulée autour d’une thématique spécifique. Des spécialistes et des responsables politiques présentent la thématique du jour et permettent aux jeunes parlementaires d’élaborer une contribution PJE AP. - Force de proposition. La contribution PJE APE est présentée au CBAP par l’entremise d’un porte-parole des jeunes. Nous pouvons d’ailleurs considérer que ces contributions soient explicitement débattues par les membres du comité de bassin et inclues aux décisions collégiales, dont le SDAGE. - Force de veille. A l’égard de l’urgence environnementale et de la nécessité de prendre des actions, le PJE AP permet de garantir la juste discussion de ces problématiques et leur mise à l’agenda. Représentativité d’une jeunesse plurielle. Le PJE AP est désormais composé de deux collèges. Le principe de composition des comités de bassin selon les différents usages de l’eau a également inspiré l’organisation de la version n°3 du PJE AP.

This is always done in collaboration with our partners in Germany. We are always joined by two members from Germany to form our preliminary team who are all volunteers in every project. The team is sent to the benefiting communities to collect data about the prevailing water situation. This data is analyzed in order to know the best solutions to the prevailing problems. An implementation plan is outlined and a budget is prepared considering transportation, tools and equipment needed. An appointment is booked with our sponsors to pitch our presentations to them about the prevailing situation and how we intend to address them. Our proposals go through thorough scrutiny for feasibility of our selected solutions based on our proposed plans. After convincing all our sponsors, we receive and collate funds from them in pool for a particular project. The needed tools and equipment for the project are then procured. The preliminary team is expanded during the implementation period. We always give the privilege to the benefiting community to form their own local supporting team and select their leaders. Consensus is built among our technical team and a date is set for the implementation of the project which is further communicate to the community team members. On the due date the two German volunteers would join our technical team for a trip to the community who would be readily waiting for us. Opinion leaders like local chiefs, assembly members and sometimes the government agencies in charge of water are consulted in a meeting for the first few days. The subsequent days are for the implementation of the project. Our timeline for each project do not exceed four weeks unless there are serious circumstances beyond our control. A memorandum of understanding is signed between Technology without Borders (our organization) and the benefiting community that project has become a bona fide property of the community after handing over and therefore they (the community) have to handle all maintenances to keep the project in good shape. Our technical team draws a routine follow up plan to regularly visit the communities in order to give situational reports of our previous projects. Pictures are taken throughout the entire project period which is used for our archives and reports. Report is sent to our sponsors and subsequently published in our journals.","Throughout all our previous researches, we have realized that poverty has been the number one cause of deprivation of safe drinking water for the majority of our benefiting communities. Our team has therefore decided to develop a scheme through which the water could be used to generate some funds for the community from those who patronize it. Some proceeds from these funds would be used for the day-to-day maintenance of the project. Excess funds would also be used for some form of poverty alleviation for members of the community. This is to be decided by members of the community with the consent of our organization. We would also seek to invite other agencies on board to help tackle the poverty situations by introducing some social reforms. We shall also intensify advocacy to an end for open defecation and promote community led total sanitation. This we shall do in collaboration with the various environmental health agencies.","Community Water & Sanitation Agency, Sunyani, Ghana

We train people to use our award winning method of drilling through the use of a short in-field book learning experience and hands on training. Training requires 3 days to train a 3-to-9-man group to drill water wells using our method. There are numerous other methods of drilling which we will teach on an as needed method. We will not exclude any hand drilling method. We will focus on locations that have proven water supplies.https://1drv.ms/x/s!AglCyzMf1rkIgrIw0lR1oLkpt5dW3w?e=mwhJBi We will train crews at multiple locations from a central site within 1 days travel. We will teach all manual methods and invite other manual drilling teams to use our patent. There will be no patent fees. We will train people to use all manual and power-driven methods. We will train local people to build their own manual and power- driven equipment. There will be zoom, videos and other online training. We will focus on using local universities and training schools to teach. We will be a completely open educational, training and drilling school. All religions and people will be included, no people will be excluded. We will use all available tech solutions for locating and developing water sources, including the use of treated, recycled and atmospheric water solutions. We have drilled 569 training wells; each well is capable of training 3 drillers. Our wells in alluvial plains produce 200 to 400 lpm. Our wells in alluvial plains are completed on average at 2.44 days to drill and develop each well. Some wells are fitted with pumps within the same time frame. We have invented, and distributed at no cost, pipe handling equipment unlike any other tools available. We have invented manual pipe threading tools. We have invented reciprocating percussion drilling tools that are bicycle driven. Our drilling equipment can be operated 100 percent manually or with different levels of power. We have innovated 100 percent solar powered drilling equipment. We are designing pumps that will pump water with large amounts of entrained sand. We have innovated pipe wrenches that are built of wood, yet capable of handling steel and plastic pipes. We have developed ""Water Neighborhoods"" https://1drv.ms/v/s!AglCyzMf1rkIgqotognBWNe_ldFwLQ?e=6qqbdC that incorporate a complete water cycle within the confines of the neighborhood. These neighborhoods include water for irrigation and injection wells to treat and replenish the groundwater that is extracted. The neighborhoods also contain schools, homes, businesses, and other amenities that are normally required for a fully successful life. One Million Wells has a complete plan to handle all the needs of those that require water. We have proven our concept and have developed an excel spreadsheet that allows the UN and its members to estimate the cost per person of furnishing water to the entire world:   https://tinyurl.com/2farlycc  The spreadsheet is based upon ""Actual production and cost"" as documented on our projects. The users may simply choose the lpm, or gpm of well production and then look to the lower half of the sheet and insert the quantities.","Our spreadsheet shows that it is possible to furnish everyone in the world with sustainable water through the use of our processes and by locating water wells in the appropriate locations. Our methods of training and education are self exponentially operative. Our spreadsheet combined with our inventions and innovations prove that we can resolve the water shortage problem. Our spreadsheet indicates that if our lower production of water rather than our higher production, per each 8-inch diameter alluvial well, as derived from the first calculation area on the sheet, is used, the average well would supply water for 1066 people. That is based upon each person receiving 135 liters of water per 12-hour day. Then in the ""Cost Calculation Worksheet"" insert in cell F15, the number “1000” as the persons that could be served each day. In cell B15 the number of persons lacking water would be inserted. In this case the number is 1.2 billion. Then in cell G15, one can insert the number of wells a crew can drill in one year. In cell H15 insert the number of years that are allowed to complete the installation of wells. In this case we are using 8 years. It is likely that the water problem will be resolved prior to that date, therefore it is a safe number. In India, we are averaging nearly 150 wells per year per 3-man crew. So, to be safe we use 125 wells per crew, per year. Then in cell I15, insert the cost of overhead for each crew, however overhead is also covered in part of the value in cells J16 through J21, so that number is safe. The cost to drill 1.2 billion water wells, exclusive of work by others, is given in cell K23. In cells K16 through K21 are listed the costs per year to attain the value in K22. The value in K22 is multiplied by the number of years in H15 to give the total cost of furnishing all wells within the parameters chosen previously. The spreadsheet does not specifically depend on other drilling methods being excluded. There have been a great number of non-functional water wells drilled. It is expected that those wells would be re-drilled by the people that previously installed them. OMW expects that all persons capable of drilling and furnishing water will continue to do so. We also expect that other methods of attaining water will be utilized as well. While we have power driven equipment that can produce water wells at a very low cost, this estimate does not incorporate the use of power-driven equipment. Our patented hydraulic top drive drill is available to be used to supplement the drilling of wells should the need arise. We anticipate that every means of production will be utilized and that we will use every possible method to complete enough water sources to supply the entire world.

            Community Health and Waterway Assessment Report","Individuals (drinking water); communities; drinking water and wastewater utilities; governments; commercial, recreational, and sustenance fishing individuals and entities; and recreational water users.",United States of America,"Africa, Europe, Asia and Pacific, North America, Latin America and the Caribbean","In 2022, Waterkeeper Alliance worked with 113 U.S. Waterkeeper groups to engage in the first of its kind nationwide survey of surface waters for Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS).   In that study, at least one species of 35 different PFAS chemicals was detected in 83 percent of the 114 waterways tested, and lesser known PFAS chemicals were found to be prevalent at many of the monitored locations. In some places, the level of contamination was thousands to hundreds of thousands times higher than what EPA experts indicate is safe for drinking water.

Building on the success of this 2022 surface water monitoring project in the United States, Waterkeeper Alliance and partners will work to enhance monitoring, data collection, and effective regulation and remediation of PFAS pollution in global waterways and to improve our collective understanding of the extent and levels of these long-lived toxic contaminants. 

PFAS are toxic to people, wildlife, and aquatic life even at very low concentrations and, due to the largely unregulated and widespread use of PFAS for many decades, it is widely expected that PFAS are present in most surface waters. Unfortunately, there has been very limited monitoring or regulation of PFAS contamination in surface waters, many of which are used for drinking, swimming, and fishing around the world. 
To meet the urgency of the moment and scale of the problem, we need high quality, scientifically sound water quality monitoring and data analysis from waterways around the world. For this initiative, assuming funding can be secured, Waterkeeper Alliance will work with Waterkeeper groups and partners in at least 10 countries to identify and evaluate surface water PFAS contamination associated with high priority wastewater treatment systems and manufacturer dischargers using publicly available data sources; through application of environmental justice screening tools; and by employing state of the art passive water quality sampling of surface waters, effluent discharges, and sludge application site runoff in partnership with SiREM. 

To our knowledge, this will be another first-of-its-kind monitoring project that will produce more representative data on PFAS equilibrium concentrations that better relate to bioavailability, toxicity, and risk assessment models than conventional grab samples. This approach will generate information and tools to support community and governmental action to (1) establish protective regulatory limits on PFAS; (2) direct infrastructure funding to highly contaminated areas with major dischargers, and to areas with disparate impacts on indigenous and environmental justice communities; and (3) create methods, resources, and tools - in multiple languages - via an online learning platform for Waterkeeper groups and other community-based organizations to utilize in their monitoring and in seeking government action on PFAS contamination. To further strengthen these policy goals, Waterkeeper Alliance will also work with professors and students at University of California, Davis, to conduct a typology and network analysis to improve coordination and expand power at the local level. Upon conclusion of the initiative, we will create communications materials to describe the extent of the problem and will present the report at a future UN Water Conference.","Despite the well-known dangers of PFAS to people and the environment, government action to monitor, control, and clean up PFAS pollution in surface waters has been wholly inadequate to protect public health, communities, and ecosystems. For example, in the United States, there are nearly 30,000 facilities discharging PFAS into surface waters, but there are currently no federal regulatory standards for controlling and remediating PFAS. This failure to regulate PFAS pollution has resulted in widespread contamination and created an urgent need for municipal wastewater and drinking water facilities to upgrade their systems with expensive treatment technologies to remove PFAS that ratepayers cannot afford. As is the case with other toxic pollution, the impacts of these failures are likely being borne disproportionately by indigenous and environmental justice communities.

This initiative will activate the Waterkeeper movement and a partner network to expand knowledge of PFAS pollution, demonstrate scientifically-sound monitoring methods for documenting PFAS contamination, and advance efforts to increase governmental controls on the release and cleanup of PFAS pollution. Waterkeeper Alliance will prioritize monitoring with Waterkeeper groups located in countries with waterways that are expected to be highly contaminated by PFAS, have PFAS contamination that disproportionately impacts indigenous and environmental justice communities, and have documented needs for regulatory standards to control and clean up this pollution. This type of monitoring will start to fill in the massive data gaps for PFAS contamination of surface waters and help direct attention to polluted areas that most urgently need governmental action on regulatory standards and infrastructure. As information becomes available about the extent and levels of PFAS contamination in highly impacted areas, governments can make decisions about banning or limiting the use of dangerous chemicals and improve regulation and management practices to clean up existing pollution and prevent future harms. In addition, this data can lead to measures such as fish consumption guidance and wastewater and drinking water treatment that can improve community health by lessening human exposure to sources of toxic PFAS pollution.

Data collected in this initiative will be presented in a way that supports community action and inspires an appropriately protective governmental response. The scientifically sound collection of data on PFAS pollution in this initiative will also generate partnership opportunities for the development of collaborative solutions to this complex problem and demonstrate innovative and reliable water quality monitoring methods that can be employed by others to expand sampling and knowledge, which is urgently needed for PFAS.","More than 300 Waterkeeper Groups in more than 45 countries with more than 1.1 million volunteers; Environmental Working Group; Southern Environmental Law Center;

            Green Meeting Index (a Chinese Group Standard) was officially released by China Biodiversity Conservation and Green Development  Foundation (CBCGDF)",Environmental Public Interest,China,Asia and Pacific,"The objectives: 
to reduce the waste of disposable bottled water - at many meetings, disposable bottled water is given out by default - whether or not attendees need it and can drink it all. After six years of surveying conferences and large convention center venues, the CBCGDF found that a lot of bottled water is wasted: it's always left over, not finished, and then just thrown away. The result is wasted water and increased plastic pollution.

Implementation methodologies 
(1) Field survey. CBCGDF has conducted unannounced visits at different Convention Centers since 2016. For example, a big conference center received more than 35 million conference attendees from November 2009 to the end of 2017, with an average of more than 4.3 million attendees per year. According to a conservative estimate of one bottle of water per day in the morning and afternoon extrapolation, the annual consumption of more than 8 million bottles of water. 
(2) CBCGDF developed the ""Green Meeting Index"" (GMI) in 2018 to lead event organizers to conduct ""green meetings"", including not issuing disposable bottled water by default. 
(3) Work with the media (Xinhua News) to reveal alarming figures on bottled water waste on World Water Day 2021, urging people to reduce bottled water waste and finish their bottles (or take them away to drink later).

Follow-up mechanism.
The joint effort with Xinhua News Agency has led to the issuance of policy documents in Beijing, Tianjin, and other cities requiring the ""light bottle initiative"". For example, on April 23, 2021, the Beijing Municipal Water Bureau launched a special campaign to ""advocate Clear Bottle actions and to eliminate water waste"". Subsequently, more and more cities began to respond by carrying out Clear Bottle to Save Water Initiative.

Governance:
The initiative began with social organizations and public concern about water waste, and CBCGDF began by investigating, advocating, and working with China's most influential media to drive change. Today, the Clear Bottle to Save Water Initiative is increasingly favored by local policy makers as a measure to implement ecological civilization.","1. The waste of bottled water is greatly reduced. It promoted the provision of bottled water on demand and encouraged participants to bring their own cups.

2. After the introduction of policies in Beijing, Tianjin and other places, China's government offices, public higher education institutions, research institutions, etc. are required not to provide disposable bottled water at meetings.

The Community will be invited to participate, contribute, and share their insight on projects with maximum interaction with the littler Droppers as speakers. This will enable participants to gain insight into several aspects of learning, technology, Innovation, creativity, leadership, and whole-brain thinking. The program also aims to promote substantial and active participation in community activities. 

All littler Droppers start the program with a short period of preparatory training. These examples describe the pattern for a program beginning in Cameroon.

1.	Reframing = (Inspire – heart connection tour – Pairing - Reflect): the program starts with a team-building week. The key aim of this week is to 'pair' the participants. Pairs live with the same family and work as volunteers. The first week starts with learning to work together as a team and enrolls the participants in the different aspects of the program. The littler Droppers. Travels to a community with a performance that creates fun and dynamic awareness. The tour is personal, interactive, and positive and functions as a kick-off. Young people become aware of the challenges in their local and global context. The exchange makes young people realize and discover that they have a significant role to play.

2.	Generating = (Education –Skill4life - Exchange - Arrival): The overseas group travels to join their southern counterparts to create the multi-national team, which forms the program's core. Living together: After the first week of arrival, the participants start to work and live in their host communities with host families. Each week includes an educational life skills activities day and four days of community work. This community work is a core activity of the program. The educational activities day allows each participant pair to lead their team in review, reflection, and experience-based learning. 

3.	Prototyping = (Activate – Act4cahnge - Create- Values, Midterm evaluation): Each team has a mid-team week halfway through the southern phase. During this period, the group spends time on reflection and assessment. Actions that young people undertake vary from awareness raising to fundraising to advocacy. One's Actions can make a difference on a personal, community, national, and international level.

4.	Communicating = (Celebrate – Share - End of Project Evaluation): At the end of the exchange period, the littler Droppers come together for the last evaluation; each group reports their activities during the program. The littler Droppers celebrate their achievements in the project together every other year on the Saturday before the UN-Water conference or COP events. To reward, empower and unite the littler Droppers and make a visible statement to national and world leaders","The “Little Drops” Exchange Program is an international initiative to actively involve young people, youths from Global South (Africa) and Global North (Developed countries). And gives them a powerful voice and engages them in building Local Resilient programs for Water Action Decade: Accelerating the implementation of the objectives of the Decade, including through the UN Secretary-General’s Action Plan.

The “Little Droppers” live and work together for six months: half in Global South and half in the Global North. Each team spends three-six months living with a local family in each Country and working on a community placement. 

The program commonly acts as a catalyst for building a career in social development or cultivating relationships with international communities and organizations. It is an intense, immersive 9-week placement for young water activists seeking international development experience at a project site in Africa and worldwide.

The structured program consists of 4 components (Reframing, Generating Values, Prototyping, and Communicating) that prepare and provide the  “Little Droppers” with the support and guidance needed for social change. This involves identifying real needs and water challenges, transforming creativity into solutions, and learning by testing and pitching the project to ensure that their work makes a lasting impact on them and the Community they serve.   Each meeting takes place in a different country and has a unique purpose: 

Every year at the UN water conference, on a day before the official kicks off, an ever-growing number of “Little Drops” will mobilize and connect simultaneously for Water Action Decade. They will be reminding world leaders to keep their promises regarding Accelerating the implementation of the objectives of the Decade, including through the UN Secretary-General’s Action Plan.

Between now and 2030, the initiative aims to create 1 million “Little Droppers” worldwide by engaging yearly in in-depth life skills programs and other water actions, advocacy, awareness, and fundraising activities.

By the end of the 2023 water conference, over 500  delegates will be reached in 10 countries, going through the program's four stages of becoming  new “ little droppers.”","Africa 54

General Public",Afghanistan,Global,"Background:

Currently, several challenges prevent the UN’s ambient water quality -related programmes and agencies (UNEP, WMO and UNESCO) from supporting UN Member States more effectively in accelerating their action to improve water quality: 
•	There are many points of contact in the mandates and programmatic activities of these organizations, resulting in possible synergies whose potential has not yet been fully realized. UNEP GEMS/Water, UNESCO IHP (IIWQ) and the WMO in its Action Plan for Hydrology work with different networks, national focal points and partners to improve monitoring, assessment and management of freshwater quality. This can be converted into an important catalyst of synergies, noting that joint actions have already started.
•	There is no mature process in place among the different UN entities to align their work in the field of water quality and to act as a single, coherent UN movement and as a point of reference for Member States. 
Within UN-Water, these programmes such as UNEP GEMS/Water and more recently established action networks such as the World Water Quality Alliance (WWQA), and the UNESCO IIWQ have improved our knowledge regarding the status and latest trends in global water quality. The Water and Climate Coalition, WCC, convened by WMO addresses aspects of water quality within the context of climate change and drivers. However, too little has been achieved to reverse the widespread deterioration of freshwater resources from pollution, ecosystem degradation and climate change. These shortfalls can be traced back to a considerable degree, to the present limitation of water quality data in addition to capacity deficits.

This initiative presents promising collaborative pathways aimed at enhancing the UN’s water quality architecture in order to accelerate action toward improving water quality. By identifying synergies, gaps, and overlaps in mandates, the new partnership-based architecture would be designed to streamline activities and increase the efficiency of interventions by fostering mutual support, coherence and collaboration between existing UN assets, communities of practice and partners across society.
Objective: 
A multilateral mechanism at the UN level coordinates the continuous monitoring, reporting, and assessment of global freshwater quality – feeding into critical assessments such as UNEPs World Water Quality Assessment and the Global Water Assessment (Proposed by UNESCO). It supports UN Member States in building and maintaining their freshwater quality monitoring, reporting, assessment and management capacities, complementary to similar existing mechanisms for water quantity (e.g. WHO WHOS and HydroSOS). It provides a coherent infrastructure for collecting data and information through the promotion and advancement of interoperability and common water quality metadata requirements whilst enabling sharing within the respective mandates of parties.","A consolidated and coherent approach to ambient water quality across the three UN Agencies will have multiple benefits at different scales:
•	A strong water quality partnership will provide a critical mass to push water quality issues higher on the political agenda (critical mass for Water Quality) including within UN-Water as well as the Member States
•	Consolidating available information and initiatives will strengthen the data and information base on water quality (contribute water quality data to the Global Water Data Portal proposed by the Water and Climate Coalition) and thereby provide a stronger knowledge base for assessments (i.e. UNEP’s World Water Quality Assessment and contribute to UNESCO’s initiative on a Water Assessment) as well as for science-policy-action agendas
•	Improved interoperability of water quality data will lead to better comparability of different water quality data provided by various member states, programs and projects and allow for broader integration and use of these data
•	Consolidation of capacity development activities on ambient water quality under the WWQA Capacity Development Consortium as contribution to the UN-Water Capacity Development initiative will assure adequate resources and support can be made available to Member States to support their water quality capacity development needs
•	Improved capacity by Member States to monitor and assess water quality will improve global reporting on SDG 632 (Ambient water quality) which is at the moment still a challenge for many countries due to a lack of sufficient data or capacities.
•	There will be an integration of various types of water quality data, including in-situ (including citizen science), Earth observation, and modeling to increase our knowledge base on water quality as much as possible including a wider group of partners and networks which are leading in the respective fields of data generation, analysis and assessment.
•	Joint outreach activities on water quality and its importance for freshwater ecosystem health will improve public awareness.","Key Leads: UNEP, WMO, UNESCO

            capacity development initiative in support of local strategies and implementation",Ghana Water Company Limited,"Ghana, Nigeria",Africa,"Despite Nigeria being blessed with various sources of water (over 215 cubic kilometers of accessible surface water), Over 86% of Nigerians do not have access to clean and safely managed drinking water which we believe is a growing scourge given the adverse effect to the population’s health, as one-third of Nigerians who have access to water, drink and utilize contaminated water. More so, Nigeria lacks proper maintenance and protection of these sources due to the absence of a solid regulatory, legal and institutional structure. Moreso, for the average Nigerian, the issue of environmental degradation isn’t requisite, hence making the issue of water scarcity and sanitization multi-dimensional. Our goal at SOCIAL GOSPEL MINISTRY is to ensure every household in Nigeria has access to clean drinking water, especially in rural areas. Secondly, we aim to ensure that Nigeria's multiple natural sources of water (such as rivers, seas, beaches, springs, lakes, and groundwater) are sustainably managed and protected by creating awareness about the essence of environmental sustainability. We aim to achieve this by collaborating with relevant stakeholders in identifying communities in dire need of water and providing plausible solutions to provide clean accessible water to the community.","In September 2022, SOCIAL GOSPEL MINISTRY identified 4 core communities in Lagos that lacked access to clean safe water, they include Jakande, Agege, Ajegunle, and Mushin. In collaboration with relevant stakeholders and members of the community, our goal is to install boreholes in these communities in order for members of these communities to access clean and safe water. Jakande is our first point of contact as conversations have been initiated with community members. Given that the lack of water is a multidimensional problem we also intend to take a multifaceted approach to create solutions that will enable us to create a sustainable future. Hence, SOCIAL GOSPEL MINISTRY is in collaboration with both private and governmental organizations to foster waste management education and environmental sanitation within these communities and provide incentives that will encourage citizens to practice proper sanitation and simple management techniques such as separation. On the other, we are also participating in campaigning for the appropriate execution of the climate change bill and sanitation laws, as a chunk of the water sources in Nigeria are polluted via the disposal of harmful wastes. Via consistent collaboration and implementation of modern solutions and approaches to these problems, it will curb many health problems, reduces drought, and deaths, and provide a more sustainable environment hence helping to an extent achieve the water sustainability goals.",Alimosho local government area suame constituency,"Goal 5, Goal 6, Goal 14","5.1 , 5.2, 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 14.1, 14.2, 14.3, 14.4, 14.5, 14.6, 14.7, 14.a, 14.b, 14.c","Thu, 02/16/2017 - 12:00",,,1.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.1098901098901103

            Effectively starts collaboration with global coalition formed with like minded organizations and networks",Climate vulnerable communities of coastal districts of Bangladesh especially the communities who are at the risk of displacement due to adverse climatic impacts.,Bangladesh,Asia and Pacific,"In South Asia, approximately 134 million who do not have access to safe drinking water. But the amount of usable freshwater that is easily accessible is rapidly shrinking. Not only that, global warming and pollution are on their high peak in recent years which lead to the freshwater sources being at a high risk. Consequently, the situation is deteriorating every day instead of improving nevertheless different initiatives are being taken, the risk and deprivation are still on the race. At the same time, the impact of climate change is making the coastal lowlands of the world uninhabitable due to the inaccessibility of safe water. A recent statistics said, 70 million people of Bangladesh, mostly the coastal people, are living under the high risk of climate change. Continuous sea level rise resulting in increased density and intensity of salinity in surface and groundwater sources as well as soil, superfluous water consumption from limited water levels for food production and meeting the household needs and severe arsenic and chemical contamination have made the safe water crisis unmanageable in coastal areas of Bangladesh more particularly in the south-western region.

AOSED as a non-profit development organization, have implemented various programs and projects in order to ensure the availability of affordable safe drinking water and ensuring people’s access to water resources in open water bodies of coastal Bangladesh. The organization has proven expertise in designing and implementing advocacy initiatives by collaborating relevant stakeholders including social and political activists, civil society groups, academia to launch issue-based campaigns, coalitions, protests, and persuasion at different levels to establish people’s access to safe drinking water.

In order to contribute in achieving the SDG6, AOSED’s initiative as leading entity will be creating a forum named People’s Alliance for Water Justice at national level comprising of relevant government, non-government, civil society organizations, research and educational institutions to work together from grassroots to policy making level in order to achieve equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water, promoting collective actions to improve water quality by reducing water pollution, increase water use efficiency and implement principles of IWRM considering adverse impact of climate change as well as capacity building of relevant stakeholders working in this sector. Through this initiative, the forum will be working as the CSO pressure group to the Government in implementing the commitments mentioned in 7th and 8th 5-year plan, Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), National Adaptation Plan (NAP), Mujib Climate Prosperity Plan in order to ensure water justice at all level. Also, the government will take initiative to develop the capacity of stakeholders through providing knowledge and technological support for effectively implementing relative activities. 

A global coalition will be established among development partners, like-minded networks and coalitions, research and educational institutes for exchanging information, knowledge, technology and expertise as well as accumulating financial resources to carry out the initiative of the National Forum.","The government of Bangladesh has made considerable progress in achieving the targets associated with SDG6. In order to achieve the 100% target by 2030, the National Forum led by AOSED will continuously monitor the implementation modalities related to SDG6. Bangladesh has integrated development targets to achieve the SDG6 in the 7th 5-year plan to ensure safe drinking water made available for all rural and urban population and proportion of urban population with access to sanitary latrines to be increased to 100 percent and 90 percent for rural population. The 7th 5-year plan made a primary financing estimation of 403 billion USD for both public and private sectors but this amount does not reflect the need or demands based financial allocation to achieve the SDG targets. According to experts, in achieving the SDGs in Bangladesh, domestic resource mobilization needs to be raised to at least 18% from the present. The National Forum led by AOSED will push government for optimized financing which is essential to get resources behind country plans, ensure continuous and uninterrupted flow of data to measure progress, build a better skilled workforce to improve service level in the water sector, innovate new and smart practices and technologies of water and sanitation resources management and service delivery, and ensuring good governance.","Networks: Butterfly Effect Network, Climate Action Network (CAN), Climate Action Network South Asia (CANSA), Freshwater Action Network (FAN), End Water Poverty, Asia Pacific Water Forum-APWF, Water, Sanitation Collaborative Council (WSSCC)

Alongside these unfavorable natural conditions, the development of industrial and agricultural activities and the extension of irrigated areas in particular have not been without consequences on the environment in general and on water resources in particular. Indeed, we have witnessed the establishment of increasingly large urban areas accompanied by industrial areas and an increased development of agricultural activity. This was the basis of a degradation of the water resource both in terms of quantity and quality. In arid areas where rainfall is below isohyet 200, and faced with the virtual non-existence of surface water resources, the exploitation of groundwater remains the only way to meet the various needs. To the south, deep sedimentary aquifers contain immense amounts of “fossil” groundwater that is not actively recharged. Groundwater from these deep aquifers has traditionally been used for centuries, on a relatively small scale, through foggaras - water galleries, and there are also larger modern catchments. The drop in groundwater levels in some areas shows that some overexploitation is taking place. In order to ensure the sustainability of this resource, which is becoming increasingly rare in the face of increasing demands, it is imperative to establish adequate governance and management. In this project, we will provide some solutions to the problem of groundwater drawdown in Algerian arid regions. In recent years GIS and electrical survey methods have become among the best techniques used for the inventory, planning, management and development of groundwater resources. The preliminary objective of our research is to build a GIS on groundwater drawdown in arid Algerian regions. The GIS and electrical prospecting methods must provide information on the extent of groundwater drawdown, their causes, but also on the areas that are at risk. The first challenge of this work is to collect data on groundwater drawdown by electrical prospecting. For this, field trips will be carried out in all Algerian arid regions. The second challenge is to map groundwater through GIS, including groundwater affected by drawdown. The third challenge is to install piezometers in a few reference boreholes in arid regions. The fourth challenge is to create a computerized alert system SMART INFO-NAPPE Arid regions Methods: Geoinformatics , Electrical Conductivity, Groundwater Modeling, Geophysical Survey, Geological Mapping, GIS","To this end, the objectives of this project are: - Creation of water table drawdown warning systems intended for local, regional and national decision-makers. - In-depth study of groundwater drawdown in arid regions - Feasibility study of artificial and direct recharge of unconfined aquifers via the Albian aquifer - Contribution to the protection of the water table in arid regions against the abusive exploitation of groundwater. - Support of socio-economic operators in the search for groundwater by geophysical methods in order to avoid traditional methods (causes of random drilling of boreholes).

            The proposed solar water supply and irrigation project covers 687 administrative units across the country",Ministry of Local Government Uganda,Uganda,Africa,"For farmers across Africa, access to water is critical to producing crops, and with a good solar irrigation system, the very same farmers can have yearlong farming yields rather than the twice-yearly of short and long rain seasons, undoubtedly promoting better agricultural outcomes. For farmers, solar power has become increasingly necessary for irrigation as a reliable, clean-energy solution for agricultural water management, especially in areas with high levels of solar radiation. A commodity that is freely available and through solar irrigation technology provides local farmers better planning and increased stocks to market at a highly cost effective and consistent way. A cleaner, more reliable solution that reduces the cost of farming significantly. The solar panels used in our solar water pump systems produce electricity by using the photovoltaic effect. These solar panels absorb the sun’s photons and convert them into energy. This is the main component of a solar water pump system. A group of solar panels is called an array. At Advanced Power, we create all of our own photovoltaic solar panels with durable material that will allow our solar panels to last for years to come The pump is the piece of equipment that draws water from the source to be used for different applications. Water can be drawn from a well, pond, or other sources and used to help with agriculture, irrigation, and other settings. Advanced Power offers our pumps in both AC and DC power. You can find submersible pumps, circulation pumps, booster pumps, and sump pumps in our collection of solar water pumps When you invest in a solar water pump system, an inverter is another important component. Inverters are used to convert direct currents (DC) output into an alternating current (AC), which can be used to power electrical grids and off-grid electrical networks. This conversion is necessary for many electrical devices, including the water pumps, making inverters an important part of the solar pump system. The inverter from Advanced Power is a great source of backup power when you need it. If you find yourself struggling through cloudy or low-light days, an inverter can help to keep your water pump running, even without solar. Solar pump systems are important in maximizing pump performance. Controllers can be used to essentially control the water pump. Advanced Power offers a variety of controllers that can help your water pump run more efficiently. Controllers can be used to set a pumping schedule, turn the pump on or off, and help maximize the life of your pump. If you are pumping from a well or water source that often faces low water levels or dry situations, we offer controllers with water sensors, which will turn off the pump when water is low.","In its blossoming stages, solar energy was primarily used to supply electric energy to homes and offices that were far from a power grid. Over time, solar energy has found its way into other sectors and applications. As a renewable energy source, there is no fear of its depletion, unlike fossil-fueled energy such as coal, gas, and petroleum. Transitioning from non-renewable sources of energy to renewable ones has opened the door to a myriad of possibilities. It has also increased the demand for solar panel installations making the cost less prohibitive. Solar energy has made significant inroads into daily living, agriculture, and transportation. While solar energy has focused on supplying electricity for space heating and lighting, it has expanded to include solar drying, solar cooling and refrigeration, and cooking. Rural areas depend on agriculture and need to access renewable sources of energy to make a sustainable living. Agricultural processing such as irrigation, poultry lighting, and pest control do not require high energy output and solar photovoltaic cells are a proven choice as an energy source.",Ministry Of Water and Environment Uganda Ministry of Agriculture Animal Industry and Fisheries Uganda UK Export Finance Uganda,"Goal 2, Goal 4, Goal 6, Goal 13","2.1 , 2.3, 2.4 , 4.1, 4.2, 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.a, 13.b","Fri, 01/01/2021 - 12:00","Mon, 12/30/2024 - 12:00",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OwzosVG_z-c https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFpL5gKJZtM https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lERhT6O0bTc,1.0,0.6666666666666666,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

The Dakar Action Plan for basins provides the technical definition of the principles for actions and commitments needed. It mobilizes the main stakeholders of basin management (basin organisations and committees, ministries, donors, water users' associations, etc.). It calls for acceleration of the achievement of the SDGs by strengthening cooperation, planning, the legal and institutional framework of basin organisations, and the search for innovative financing. Basin organizations are peacemakers and accelerators of sustainable development. National or transboundary, they are, by construction, multi-stakeholder platforms. They are places for dialogue, between countries on a transboundary scale, between users and water stakeholders on a sub-national scale. Cooperation at the level of river basins and on a transboundary scale can be done through Transboundary Basin organizations (TBOs) are a relevant framework for transboundary management. The objective of the Dakar Action Plan for basins is to accelerate the achievement of SDGs by and for basin organizations. Under the framework of this plan, basin organizations will strengthen their mobilization to: 1. Confirm their role and effectiveness for Water security, peace, sustainable development. 2. Accelerate implementation of SDGs, in particular to record improvement for: Indicator 6.5.1 “Degree of integrated water resources management implementation (0-100)” Indicator 6.5.2 “Proportion of transboundary basin area with an operational arrangement for water cooperation”. 3. Reinforce upstream-downstream integration and facilitate water resources allocation. IWRM supporters, and in particular bi and multilateral donors and UN Member States will support basin organizations by: 4. Strengthening institutional frameworks, including for transboundary Basin Organizations (TBOs). 5. Strengthening data sharing practices and shared Water Information Systems. 6. Strengthening dissemination of practices and tools for water users participation and awareness raising. 7. Strengthening exchanges with other policy levels. The steering committee of the Dakar Action Plan for basins (Senegal, Morocco, Switzerland, the International Network of Basin Organizations, UNECE, OMVS and OMVG) will be in charge of its governance and will follow-up the implementation of the commiments made. The official high level segment dedicated to basin management in each editions of the World Water Forum will a milestone for reporting of the progress made.","The implementation of the Dakar Action Plan in the signatory basins will of course accelerate the achievement of Target 6.5, which ""aims to implement integrated water resources management (IWRM)"". Of course, the improvement of IWRM at basin level will also accelerate the achievement of the overall SDG6 on Water, and in particular target 6.1 ""universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all"". All drinking water taps ultimately depend on the basins of lakes, rivers and aquifers. More broadly, an improved management of the basins of rivers, lakes and aquifers will greatly contribute to consistency in the sustainable development of differents sectors and to achieve water, food and (last but not least in this day and age) energy securities. This improved Water-Food-Energy Nexus will accelerate the achievement of related SDG2 (and hunger, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture) and SDG7 energy) The Dakar Action Plan for basins will also provide deliver on: - integrated development planning of cities and their supply in water resources (a contribution to SDG11), - capacity building of countries for the design and implementation of basin plans to adapt to climate-related hazards and natural disasters (a contribution to SDG13), - preservation of the marine and terrestrial biodiversity that depend on healthy waters (a contribution to SDG14 & SDG15) - more effective and accountable institutions and in particular basin organizations (a contribution to SDG16) and additional financial resources for developing countries to improve their record on IWRM at basin level (a contribution to SDG17).","The Member States of France, Morocco, Senegal and Switzerland.

The AguaClara technologies don’t require any electricity, have a minimum of moving parts, are built using locally available materials, and are based on the latest science of particle and pathogen removal. This innovative approach to providing safe water on tap has been proven since 2006 with 23 water treatment plants in Central America that are providing over 10 billion L/yr of safe water on tap.",We recognized that there are millions of small cities and towns that have contaminated water on tap. These communities struggle to maintain their water supply and distribution systems because households aren’t willing to pay much for dirty water. We’ve demonstrated with 23 water treatment plants in Central America that once a town has an AguaClara water treatment plant that households are willing to pay a higher water tariff and the whole water supply system becomes sustainable. A major reason why achieving the SDG goal for safe water has been difficult is that the global community has been unable to go the whole way to safe. The poor quality of water delivered makes the entire water supply system unsustainable because households aren’t willing to pay very much for water that isn’t safe to drink. A major reason why communities don’t have safe water on tap is because there haven’t been any technologies that work reliably for small cities and towns. AguaClara water treatment plants are revolutionary because they were designed from the ground up to work for communities. Our nearly 100% success rate in sustainable delivery of safe water in Honduran and Nicaraguan communities demonstrates that going the whole way to safe water on tap results in a sustainable service.,"Agua Para el Pueblo

            National Water Policy - Mali","Beneficiaries: farmers, rural populations, local communities, etc",Mali,Africa,"Water is a finite natural resource, necessary for life and ecological systems, and essential for economic and social development. Today, water resources in general are facing major constraints such as climate variability and change, increased demand, degradation of water quality, conflicts of use and national (upstream/downstream) or international (shared watercourses) tensions over resource sharing. To address these concerns better management of water resources should be considered. This requires an integrated approach to water resources management, the objective of which will be to: - plan the use of the resource, and practice a water saving policy; - involve men and women equitably, then prevent and manage conflicts related to water use; - satisfy legitimate and reasoned requests in a global way (agriculture, electricity, domestic uses, transport, industry, leisure, aquaculture, fishing, etc.); - preserve ecosystems and prevent risks (erosion, drought, floods).","This integrated approach is all the more necessary since most uses of water bring benefits (economic and social) to society, but they can also have negative impacts (particularly on the environment). This situation can be made worse by insufficient management procedures, lack of regulation or lack of motivation caused by the water governance regimes in place. In order to grasp all the issues relating to the current state of water resources and to face the challenges of sustainable management of water resources, both surface and groundwater, the actors must have the required knowledge and control capacities. management and planning tools. Capacity building therefore appears to be an essential link in the IWRM implementation mechanism. Moreover, our contribution can be perceived, in this perspective, as a contribution of our action in the training of actors in the sector to enable them to acquire the knowledge and know-how necessary for the development and management of water resources.","Partners: The Malian State and Technical and Financial Partners (FAO, IFAD, World Bank, GIZ, ACDI, USAID, etc.)","Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 6, Goal 8, Goal 13, Goal 15, Goal 17","1.1, 1.2 , 1.3 , 2.1 , 2.2, 2.3, 2.4 , 2.5, 2.a, 2.b, 2.c, 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 8.1, 8.2 , 8.3, 8.4, 8.5, 8.6, 8.7 , 8.8, 8.9, 8.10, 8.a, 8.b, 13.1, 13.2, 13.3, 13.a, 13.b, 15.1, 15.2, 15.3, 15.4, 15.5, 15.6, 15.7, 15.8, 15.9, 15.a, 15.b, 15.c, 17.1, 17.2, 17.3, 17.4, 17.5, 17.6, 17.7, 17.8, 17.9, 17.10, 17.11, 17.12, 17.13, 17.14, 17.15, 17.16, 17.17, 17.18, 17.19",,,,1.0,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

The most valuable and significant natural resource on Earth is water.It keeps all life going.Without water, life cannot exist.Water is essential not only for humans but also for the ecosystem as a whole.Animals and humans cannot survive in an environment devoid of water.After outside air, water is the second most significant regular asset for the endurance of any living being. Every living thing on this planet, from the smallest worm to the largest tree, needs water to survive.Without water, plants and animals cannot exist.Water covers about 71% of Earth's surface.Sadly, freshwater accounts for only 3% of the available water.Glaciers and ice caps that have frozen over account for approximately two-thirds of the freshwater.Groundwater and surface water account for the remaining small amount.","Throughout their negotiation and subsequent adoption, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) set by the United Nations have come under fire.Some of these criticisms have centered on the fact that the goals are not legally enforceable and that nations are left to establish their own implementation frameworks.The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) include a number of vague and merely aspirational goals.Some people think that the objectives are contradictory because they make good noises in the areas of society and the environment without really addressing the economic systems that have caused problems in the other two areas.Others would contend that political considerations, such as democracy and human rights, are neglected. A lot of this can be seen as the price of the SDGs' accomplishments:15 years of consensus among nations on a development plan to serve as our guide.In order for opposing viewpoints and values to unite around a single position, pragmatism is required.The more important question is whether agreement is followed by action. No nation is on track to achieve all 17 goals, as we can see here.Many have not even taken the most fundamental steps to endorse the SDGs or include them in their budgets.The climate and biodiversity situation is described as ""alarming"" by the United Nations in its most recent progress report.The UN meetings that took place in September were framed by these facts.Therefore, there is action, but evidently not enough.

	Coastal regions and their communities (globally)",Netherlands,"Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean, Global","The essence of Xploration Coastline is to match the demand of water production & treatment in the most energy efficient way for multiple small Islands and/or multinational coastline regions.

The Xploration Coastline concept describes a network of floating (mobile) water production & treatment plants (assets) that operate coordinated along a coastline or between groups of Islands. This network is centrally operated. Operations are fully automated. Data (demand, weather, logistics, maintenance, etc.) and AI optimize operations as they learn. A governance body - a committee with a solid support base in the region - is in place to take overall responsibility and declare priorities in case of escalation beyond routine operations.

The asset is a floating maritime water and energy microgrid and is capable of delivering 1000 cubic meters of potable water every 24 hours. The asset has a minimal footprint optimizing the integrated clean energy systems on board. The modular build enables customization of every asset depending on demand, operation mode and/or role in the Xploration Coastline network. All processes on board are automated focussing the need for human capital on predictive (and incident) maintenance and towage.

The first of class will be operated from Curaçao in Sint Joris baai facilitating agricultural and regional development in that area. Meanwhile the asset is stand-by to provide pre-planned, efficient and (more) sustainable Humanitarian Aid within the region. Partnerships with the local utility company and the University of Curacao have been established. An actionable plan has being worked out with policymakers of Curaçao and is signed by the Board of Ministers. Meanwhile a community of practitioners is active to, in this stage, share knowledge and experiences to act on the motto: ‘for all, by all’.

The advancement of technologies in the power-2-H2O value chain will be significant. The Xploration Coastline Living Lab enables us to accommodate all new inputs - independent of their Technology Readiness Level (TRL). This Living Lab will kick-off in Aqua-dock Rotterdam. In a local public-private- partnership this Minimum Viable Product will be upgraded together with local schools, universities, institutions, entrepreneurs and government.

The multilayer governance structure of Xploration Coastline is divided over three entities: a vision-keeper, a mission-keeper and an asset responsible entity. Each entity has its responsibility and unique role within the grand Xploration. This governance structure is able to provide clarity and legality for all involved, now and for the future.

The vision is anchored in society by Foundation OceansX. Foundation OceansX is set out to unleash our collective potential around complex social challenges.

The mission is the responsibility of OceansX Ltd. An actionable entity that formulates, drives and pivots the Xploration Coastline mission, being: drive cumulative successes in line with the essence of Xploration Coastline. OceansX Ltd. has and is limited to one stakeholder being Foundation OceansX.

The asset responsibility is delegated towards a consortium of companies and/or institutions who are in charge of building, maintaining and operating the (network of) asset(s). Every consortium operates under a license (per geographical area, time, etc.) of OceansX Ltd.","The expected impact of Xploration Coastline Curaçao is threefold:

1. Provide the first need for drinking water in an efficient and sustainable way for Humanitarian aid operations: Xploration Coastline Curacao concept is able to deploy a mobile asset delivering 1000m3 of potable water in the Caribbean part of the Dutch Kingdom and the Caribbean region. This supports local authorities and international aid organizations in the region to optimize operations. This by enhancing standardization, enabling proactiveness, driving efficiency and sustainablility when providing quick-response clean drinking water and sanitary facilities. Xploration Coastline Curaçao supports objective 6.1 of the UN Sustainable Development goals, regarding universal and equal access to safe and affordable drinking water for everyone, objective 3.9 on reducing the death rate due to unsafe water, unsafe sanitary facilities and lack of hygiene and other environmental factors, and also objective 13.1 on strengthening the resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in the region.

2. Provide water security to facilitate the development of agriculture in order to enhance food security for the residents of Curaçao (and SIDS): Curacao's food security is for 97% dependant on import. And the Island is no exception. Xploration Coastline Curacao concept drives the development of 450 acres of land destined for agriculture. This development is a holistic social-economic movement enabled (and kick-startet) by the provision of low-cost second grade water. Food security will reduce the dependance on import and so reducing the variability in the cost of living and so increasing the quality of life. When the concept proves itself the knowledge, produce and concepts will strengthen the local economy. Xploration Coastline Curaçao thus supports objective 2.4 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, regarding the ensuring sustainable food production systems and application of resilient agricultural practices that increase productivity and production, which help maintain ecosystems, which are the ability to adjust climate change, extreme weather conditions, drought, floods and other disasters strengthen and that gradually improve the quality of land and soil.

3. Provide an open innovation platform to reduce the integration time for knowledge, insights, exeperiences and technologies as they come along: Xploration Coastline Curaçao governance structure and facilities create an open innovation platform with public and private partners to stimulate social and technical innovation in the water-food-energy nexus. By doing Xploratie Coastline Curaçao, as a first of class concept, can grow into a regional icon project integrating local stakeholders and initivatives and driving custom-fit solutions. Xploration Coastline Curaçao supports objective 17.17 of the UN Sustainable Development Goals, regarding the promotion of effective public, public -private and social partnerships, building on the experience and network of partnerships, and also objective 9.4 on improving infrastructure and adjusting industries to enhance sustainability, with a more efficient use of resources and a greater application of clean and environmentally friendly technologies and industrial processes.","Government of Curaçao

Implementation:
Save Water Campaign: Firstly, to resolve this issue we must bring awareness to the people about the present water scarcity and if we don’t save water now what will happen in near future. It can be done through the World Water Day saving water campaign in various educational institutions, Govt. offices, Bus Stations, Railway Stations, Apartments, different communities, road shows, rallies etc.  Secondly, give them various ways to save water like rain water harvesting, water conservation and reuse the used water so that water will go back to the earth again. Thirdly, we can revive the water bodies. To do all this we need to train a group of volunteers who can train others to save water.

Safe Water: In India, the constitutional right to access to clean drinking water can be drawn from the right to food, the right to clean environment and the right to health, all of which have been protected under the broad heading of the right to life, guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. We want to install borewells where there is no access to drink water and provide water filters to get safe and clean water.  Accordingly we will reach out to the neighboring countries as well","Save Water Project: We will create a national movement to save water and mostly in urban India where people do have access to water but no sense of saving water. We wish to see the next generations especially the children and youth to take up this campaign forward so that we can save water to save the generation.

Safe Water Project: We wish to create a generation who solder with others to help getting safe drinking water mostly in rural India. We wish to see everyone have access to safe drinking water so that waterborne diseases will be uprooted from our nation and unprivileged will have access to clean drinking water.","Partners are the civil societies,  indigenous  groups, mission associations, trusts and societies and educational institutions","Goal 1, Goal 2, Goal 6, Goal 13","1.4, 2.2, 6.1 , 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a, 6.b , 13.3","Thu, 12/01/2022 - 12:00","Mon, 12/01/2025 - 12:00",,1.0,0.5555555555555556,0.0,0.125,1.0,0.2197802197802206

•	To study nature of environmental crisis that had affected the Bero block during 60’s 
•	To study the recurring aspect of the crisis of the Bero Block
•	To study the nature of his experience of the crisis
•	To study the nature of his observation on the crisis that his villages faced 
•	To study the initial steps that Mr. Simon Oraon taken to overcome the crisis
•	To study the nature of cooperation he received from the co-villagers
•	To study the nature of help he received from people
•	To study whether aid from the government and non-governmental organization provided to him
•	To study the outcome of this initiatives
•	To study response / feedback on his initiatives
•	To study the Padmashree award and people response towards his popularity

Methodology:
The Guidelines for fieldworks employed in this study are drawn from Kenneth S. Golstein’s. A Guide for Field Workers in Folklore (1964, Hatboro, Pennsylvania: The American Folklore Society).

Data Collection Methods
Data for this study have been collected using the following collection methods
•	Observation
•	Interview

Observation method:
This method has been used to look at the initiatives of Mr. Simon Oraon from the outside in and to describe the situations as we see. For effective field collection, non-participant observation collecting method has been used.

Interview method
Though it is a common field method employed by data collectors, it has been used in this study to get to know what the informant knows, believes, expects, feels, wants, does, or has done, etc. The non-directive interview method has been found to be useful for data collection in this study.","Reviving, Encouraging, using traditional knowledge;
It is our clear example from the Bero block that the traditional knowledge or local knowledge can be utilized to overcome the natural crisis. The realization of traditional knowledge and growing concern about its continued erosion, have prompted a number of countries to adopt policies and programmes recognizing and promoting it. International agencies, NGOs and indigenous peoples or local communities themselves, have also initiated a number of measures. The recognition of Mr. Simon Oraon for this coveted award must be seen in this background.

Following is the list of principles proposed in the International Council of Science and UNESCO with reference to traditional knowledge in relation to sustainable development: (ICSU 2002).
•	Ensure the full and effective participation of traditional knowledge holders during all stages of elaboration of sustainable development policies, plans and programmes alongside the scientific and technological community
•	Acknowledge and respect the social and cultural base within which this knowledge is embedded
•	Recognize the rights of traditional people to own, regulate access and share benefits of their unique sets of knowledge, resources and products
•	Ensure that traditional knowledge holders are fully informed of potential partnerships 
•	Promote model for environmental and sustainable governance 
•	Promote training to better equip young scientists and indigenous people to carry out research on traditional knowledge.

Concluding Remarks:
•	Traditional knowledge is the finest system developed by traditional community in a cognitive encounter with the social, cultural and environmental crisis. 
•	It includes and not excludes all aspects of socio-cultural, political, spiritual life of people. 
•	As an alternative system, it negates the domination and dominant model of development by providing a frame of understanding the things inwardly for finding solutions within the given settings. 
•	And it is less dependent on the external or foreign substances, and it exploits locally available materials and human resource. 
•	As it is collective, the whole community claims the credit for the initiative by acknowledging the lead role of the torch bearer.

This study recommends that: 
•	The traditional bearers  in the community must be capacitated to manage the transmission of their knowledge to the younger generations.
•	Awareness programs are the need of the hour to empower the local communities to actively participate in the development process. 
•	An integrated approach can be preferred for the conservation and management of natural resources.
•	Innovative ways can be identified at all resource levels.
•	Creation of hybrid knowledge by incorporating both traditional and modern technologies.
•	The cultural life or folk life of the local communities must not be disturbed by the external agencies.",,Goal 6,"6.2, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.b","Wed, 11/14/2012 - 12:00","Tue, 12/11/2018 - 12:00",https://juniperpublishers.com/cerj/pdf/CERJ.MS.ID.555618.pdf,0.625,0.1111111111111111,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515

Indirect beneficiaries: Stakeholders being engaged under the capacity development component of the initiative. These include 46 stakeholder organizations as of now.",Pakistan,Asia and Pacific,"Australia-Pakistan Water Security Initiative (APWASI) is a four year (2021-2025) Australian Aid funded project that aims to strengthen cooperation between Australia and Pakistan on urban water resources management. 
Objectives: 
a.	Improve access to safe water and sanitation services for two targeted disadvantaged communities, particularly vulnerable groups through demonstration of low-cost Nature Based Solutions (NbS) [site-specific interventions [Water Sensitive Cities (WSC) approach]. 
b.	Ensure community resilience to climate change and other water related shocks through a mix of locally suitable interventions. 
c.	Build capacity and awareness of key stakeholders on urban water management, as well as educating and sensitizing local communities, youth and other users about water use and conservation
The APWASI will achieve the following End Of Programme Outcomes: 
a.	Safe Water and Sanitation: By 2025, two disadvantaged urban communities in Rawalpindi and Islamabad, Pakistan will have safer and more reliable access to water and sanitation services, particularly for women. 
b.	Resilient Communities: By 2025, improved governance of urban water systems in two Pakistani cities enhances community resilience to climate change and other water-related shocks. 
APWASI, being people-powered and people-centred, believes that community involvement, in the planning and execution of any intervention, leads to more effective and equitable development. Therefore, the team planned on channeling all of the community-based interventions through Community Based Organizations (CBOs). In one critical respect this practice is well founded: CBOs often emerge and play an important role in providing public goods and in resolving collective action problems when formal institutions are deficient. For this very reason, the primary function of CBOs is kept as support towards implementing the Water Sensitive Cities vision through robust community engagement. Gender-inclusiveness was ensured by the project team as a one-to-one male to female ratio was ensured during the formation of CBOs. 

APWASI planning has been conducted keeping in mind the idea that once the restricted funding is exhausted and the team pulls out of the demonstration sites, the WSC approach should still be practiced and the operation and maintenance of the interventions be ensured. The methods being utilised for this purpose are:
•	Education and sensitization of communities on water sensitive cities, water reuse and conservation. 
•	Establishment of an ownership mechanism through a community owned, community led collection of funds.
•	Development of capture, reuse and replenish systems such as groundwater / aquifer recharge and replenishment over a long period of time for improved/ sustainable water supply 
•	Improvement in liveability through adoption of water sensitive city practices and technologies
•	Capacity development of key stakeholders and communities on operation and maintenance of all interventions.","While APWASI alone cannot cover all of what is essential to achieve SDG 6, it can demonstrate that by working at multiple levels, through a Water Sensitive Approach, access to water in urban regions can be improved while also positively contributing to downstream communities. The action directly targets around 24,500 people for whom access to safe and affordable drinking water will be ensured. Moreover, rainwater harvesting and greywater reuse is being introduced at the project demonstration sites to improve overall water resource management. This may not look like a needle mover but is a pilot of how SDGs can be implemented at community level and can go all the way (upscaled) up to the country level. This action interlinks with SDG 11 as the entire programme is people powered and people centered and ensures deep participation of the communities for urban water management. Moreover, greenspaces will be developed in order to improve liveability of the disadvantaged communities.  SDG 13 is part of the action as capacity development of communities on climate resilience and adaptation strategies and support in implementation such as green spaces to improve permeability and cater to urban heat. Lastly, SDG 17 cuts through the action as the funding has been diverted through a developed country towards a developing country in order to demonstrate best practices on water sensitive urban design. Implementation/technical partnerships have also flourished in the course of the project.","International Water Management Institute (IWMI)

This will see us in a near future seeing the current generation able to offer innovation, solutions to their adjacent problems. The reason why we chose to work with young generation is because, the young people compose of 75% of the total world population, there we will achieve great results when working with them. The other reason is because its a sustainable approach, as they have the power and energy to adapt this process, and use them in the future. Follow-up mechanism We have made our own mandate and responsibility to take care of our project which are within our reach, for those that are far from us, using our partnership with the National Youth Council- Nyandarua Chapter, Unison Self Help Group and schools, they have seen our project follow-up work very smooth and efficient. Governance GREYEA is entirely governed by youths, from our founder, Mr. Muriithi, Chairman, Mr. Kinuthia and all the members under GREYEA constitution. Implementation Methodologies We decided to use schools as our startup work stream, since schools are confined at one place and have land resources to plant trees which is our main objective. Our area of operation is initially based in Kenyatta University and Nyandarua County. the reason why we decide to use the two areas is because, most of our members are students in Kenyatta university, while Nyandarua is a county that has dependable rainfall to support our trees when we plant them, this will reduce the cost of maintaining our projects.","Improve tree cover in the county by 2030 Through collaboration with schools, acknowledge youth kids, students the need to conserve our environment Create awareness to local communities of climate change and engage them fully towards climate mitigation and adaptation.

Inspired by the impact it created in the villages, the project continued in a small way for a few years mainly in partnership with Odisha’s biggest NGO, Gram Vikas. In 2014, we partnered with Grundfos Foundation for the first time where the pump and the solar system were funded by them for 100 pumps in 100 villages. The additional infrastructure required in the villages like overhead tanks, water supply pipes, etc were facilitated by the funds mobilized by our partner NGOs. The beneficiaries were directly involved in the works of making the tanks, laying the pipelines, forming a self organized water committees, etc. Thus, the project continued to expand in coming years with this tripartite model of implementation. We have reached more than 400 villages through the project with the continued support from the Grundfos Foundation and the local NGO partners which has touched the lives of more than 1.2 Lakh lives.","The project continues to be a game changer in the remote locations being an appropriate solution in the context of the geography, infrastructure and economic conditions of the population. Grundfos solar water pumps have proven to be a robust solution for the water  accessibility issues along with solar energy itself, a sustainable source feeding the pumps. 
From the experience on ground and rural India being not well connected with stable electricity, solar energy solutions have proven to be appropriate solutions to reach the remote location to bring water access at the doorsteps. The robustness of Grundfos pumps and our system ensures water supply with little to no financial requirements for maintenance of the systems for atleast 10 years. Since our project also works with preconditions of the beneficiaries' direct involvement in the maintenance of the system by creating functional village level institutions with a minimum household level fund collection towards maintenance of the systems to be kept within the communities, our project has proven to be sustaining and accelerating the process of getting waster accessibility easier and sustainable.","Funding support - PDJF/Grundfos Foundation,

In addition to the construction of a treatment station capable of producing the entire projected daily volume, and equipped with an alert station to monitor the quality of the water produced, the project will finance (i) 8 water reservoirs capacities varying between 2,000 and 10,000 m3; (ii) a distribution network of 880 km, or 53% of the current network; (iii) 66,144 social connections, for the poorest households; and (iv) 1,108 standpipes, particularly in precarious neighborhoods, the multiplication of these standpipes and their proximity to users contributing to lowering the price of water for these vulnerable populations. The project will also support capacity building of intervention structures, the drinking water heritage company (SOMAPEP-s.a), the drinking water management company (SOMAGEP-s.a), the Electricity and Water (CREE) and the Ministry of Environment and Sanitation (MEA). The project works will involve local SMEs and SMIs as well as young people through labour-intensive works (HIMO) for the digging of trenches and the construction of standpipes. In addition to the time savings it will generate, the project will also promote the management of standpipes by women and people with disabilities. All of these measures will have a significant impact on reducing urban poverty.

This operation is justified by the current situation of water stress experienced by the city of SAN. The current access rate of the city of SAN to drinking water is low, it is estimated at 26%. It is not uncommon for this situation of deficit to create great tension in certain neighborhoods of the CITY.  

The implementation of the project will make it possible, through training sessions and studies carried out for the MEA and the CREE, to (i) update the SAN sanitation master plan, 

ii) identify a sanitation component related to this DWS project,  

iii) propose an adequate organizational and institutional framework for the urban sanitation sub-sector,  

iv) regulate the price of water at standpipes, in order to make access easier for the poor,  

v) set up the geographic information system (GIS) for SOMAPEP-s.a. ","Water is one of the most basic human needs.

Uplift WASH aims to build water wells and clean sanitation facilities to ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. Our vision for Uplift WASH program is to reduce morality rate by focusing on providing clean & safe drinking water and sanitation facilities for poor & underprivileged communities. 

- We worked directly with a family to install tube-well and as result they now have access to clean drinking water. 

- We provided clean water & food to over 300 families in flood impacted regions.

- Currently, we are working with a widow with disabled children in Bangladesh to build sanitation facilities with proper privacy and tube-well so they can have access to clean drinking water & safe sanitation. 

- We are planning to work with local NGO in Bangladesh, Pakistan, and India, and etc to build community well & sanitation facility to provide clean water & sanitation to wider audience.

The initiative aims to reduce the impact of industrial wastewater (quantitative, qualitative and GHG) by bringing companies on a journey from compliance to impact driven actions. It is based on 3 pillars:
1/ A light weight commitment based on existing standards and frameworks and using CDP reporting (timeline progression: own facilities compliance; tier 1 suppliers compliance; science-based evaluation of impacts to drive collective action at watershed scale)
2/ A tool to prioritize the sites where action is most impactful. The Wastewater Impact Assessment Tool (WIAT) is available in test version. This tool is being improved for a launch in Q1 2023. WIAT  is a facility scale water quality tool that provides a global overview on the level of impacts of the corporation’s own facilities and pressure context of its suppliers.
3/ An impact assessment guide (under development in alignment with the Science Based Targets for Nature - freshwater methodology)

The positive effects of pressure management are to reduce real water losses, reducing unnecessary or excessive pressures, as well as eliminating the fluctuation of strong or transient pressures. These factors frequently cause new leaks and pipe failures within water distribution networks. The direct relationship between the flow of leaks and the pressure means that the pressure modulation effect has an immediate impact on the amount of water supplied in a sector, the savings are directly proportional to the pressure reduction, so the savings in daytime hours is very important, however, at nighttime when consumption decreases this saving is maximized, representing on average up to 20% of the expenditure supplied before modulation.",- Leakage reduction for sustainable development - Continuous protection of pipelines - Leak reduction - Water management and control in times of drought - Recovery of delivered water flow,"CONAGUA (Mexican Federal Water Authority), Nuevo Leon State Government, Fondo Ambiental Metropolitano de Monterrey (FAMM)",Goal 6,"6.1 , 6.2, 6.4, 6.5, 6.6, 6.a","Mon, 07/25/2022 - 12:00","Wed, 05/31/2023 - 12:00",,0.75,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05494505494505515

With 50L Home Coalition we are shaping a public-private collaboration platform to respond to the (a) increasing water stress levels globally, and (b) an urgent need to reduce GHG emissions from buildings and infrastructure (Water heating is the second largest source of GHG emissions in buildings after space heating). We envision a future where 50 litres of daily water use per person and zero carbon living is an irresistible aspiration for all. To do this we collaborate in developing innovations to reduce domestic water consumption and optimise urban water infrastructure. Ensuring consumers’ day-to-day water experiences at home are not compromised by water efficiency is a core objective of our work.

Corporate innovation plays an important role but is not sufficient to transform water systems. We can demonstrate a future in which 50L of daily use is feasible by integrating innovations inside and outside the home, but the real challenge is to scale up those innovations at the speed demanded by the mounting levels of water stress in many countries (e.g., Colorado River and Rhin River basins). 

Policy is currently a barrier to the use of water innovations at scale in many geographies (e.g., on-site reuse is banned is many cities, while others lack policy to guide reuse). To change this, multiple stakeholders shall support cities and subnational authorities in updating policies and standards. Such collaboration can accelerate the adoption solutions our cities need to both reduce unnecessary water use (particularly hot water), and reuse water on site (e.g., toilet flushing).  

Our objective is to engage with a group of ‘champion cities’ to co-develop the enabling environment for scaling up water efficiency and systems decarbonisation. 

With our support, public sector practitioners will : share insights and ideas from cities and utilities; obtain support for their new ideas on how to incentivise the adoption of water and energy solutions; develop approaches to influence policy changes to enable water efficiency and resilience.  

Our Coalition will help cities by supporting and organising: Network gatherings and visits with city and utility leaders; Seed funding grants for cities to design and execute scaling-up projects and/or small pilots solutions; and A collaborative platform for policy and co-development.","To accelerate systemic change, we will work with 30 cities by 2030. We envisage policy will be reformed in multiple cities based on templates/models created by the community of ‘Champion Cities’ we’re beginning to shape.  

As a result, these cities will plan their infrastructure upgrades and new developments based on new performance standards and better incentive models (including rebates). By scaling up this approach, water systems will be more resilient, cities will find more avenues to decarbonise their building sector, and the movement to decarbonise the built environment will gain further momentum.","World Economic Forum, 2030 Water Resources Group","Goal 4, Goal 6, Goal 7, Goal 9, Goal 11, Goal 12, Goal 15","4.7, 5.c , 6.1 , 6.2, 6.5, 6.a, 6.b , 7.a, 7.b, 9.a","Sun, 04/02/2023 - 12:00","Sun, 12/01/2030 - 12:00",,0.625,0.2222222222222222,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.2197802197802206

In many cases, girls remain vulnerable to dropping out of schools and reluctant to go to schools due to lack of appropriate toilet and handwashing facilities. WASH in Schools (WinS) initiative in India reported to increase girls participation, develops positive hygiene behaviors, offers the opportunity to translates good practices in their families as well as in the community. It was further noted that children are found to be powerful agents of change not only in their homes but also in their community as well. In several cases, children act as messengers of “good hygiene practices” in their society to a great extent. Messages of good hygiene practices found to be well accepted by different sections of the society and have prolonged impact on the prevailing hygiene habit of the community. Handwashing with soap is a classical example of message transferred to the community by the awareness-cum-practical training of schoolchildren of higher secondary schools and observed a tremendous impact on the attitude of adults. Community members are also able to understand the dangers of poor sanitation and hygiene environment; and have attained the capacity to overcome the situation with remedial measures. In this context, the present intervention was undertaken entitled Children are agents of change- an intervention in Kerala on WASH in Schools with an objective to provide better hygiene behavior and healthy environment in schools in order to improve the quality of life of the future generation. Further, it was noted that if we provide safe water, better sanitation facilities and information on hygiene ; children will act as role models of the society and that will definitely reflects in their homes as well as in the community.

It was observed that 95% of households reported to be used to wash their hands with soap after defecation or on critical time. Further, 90% of people in the project area used to dump waste materials in designated places. Ninety eight percent were used to wash their hands before and after eating. The usage of toilet reported as 100% but only 65% of toilets observed as sanitary latrines. The usage of foot-wares in toilet reported to be 93%. The habit of daily cleaning of toilet was observed as 98%. Proper disposal of sanitary pads and other cloth recorded to be 90%. It was observed that 98% of households in the project area used to cover food items. Further, 94% used proper handling of drinking water. It was noticed that 90% households used to disinfect the dug well water by chlorination or some other ways of purification methods. The survey data indicated 95% of reduction of water-borne and water related diseases in the project area when compare with the previous five years.

This will affect the health and well being of school children to a large extent. School children spend most of their day-time in schools, therefore an enabling environment in schools is an important factor for their health and well-being. Water-borne and water-related diseases may spread faster in schools where children gather hours in school-time with limited spaces and unhygienic conditions. Successful and effective WASH in Schools program is a determining factor for healthy life of school children and also for joyful learning.

In India, in accordance with the convention on the Rights of the child, every child's right to education is a fundamental principle to compulsory primary school education for all. Enabling environment in schools not only includes trained teachers and neat classrooms but it includes providing child friendly WASH facilities and hygiene education. Healthy life of children in schools include provision of separate functional toilets for boys and girls, handwashing facilities with soap and have safe drinking water throughout the day.  

WASH in Schools program helps to realize the commitments on universal right to education and health; and to fulfill the agenda on Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030.","Safe water, decent sanitation facilities and information on hygiene in Schools will definitely accelerate the momentum towards SDGs.

            Final Report",All the Tribal Communities shall be taken as our Beneficiary.,India,Asia and Pacific,"Water is one of the most precious baseline elements of all living creatures beginning from Plants to Human beings. Hence, it is treated as the elixir of life. The cost of the water can not be assessed in terms of money. The history says that the ancient human settlement first developed on the banks of the River “Nile” because of the availability of the abundant water source. The Nature has given a lot of water resources. Not only we need water for our survival but also to stay comfortably we need hydropower, thermal power and some other things. The existence of the entire eco-system is based upon the availability of water resources where as the scarcity of water is the hour of the day due to rapid growth of population and rapid development in Industrial sector. Pollution of water is another curse for the human society which creates the misery and misfortune in the lives of the human beings. No doubt the pollution is increasing and it is increasing very fast due to Industrialization, Urbanization, Modernization and unification etc. Hence we should have a deeper understanding that pollution of water is the pollution in life. In fact, there is a conflict between the Nature and the Development. The Nature always wants Development, where as the Development is creating destructions. The reasons there of are fairly obvious to all that due to unsafe drinking water and poor sanitation five million people were dying every year. It is a matter of concern that the level of water related sickness continues to be high. Diseases like Diarrhea, Dysentery, Dyspepsia, Pneumonia, Typhoid, Para-typhoid, Asthma, Cholera, Ascariasis, Hookworm and Poliomyelitis are caused by water contamination and the lack of water quality surveillance is acutely brought into focus during the episodes of water born epidemics. These diseases consume lots of money for Medical attention and medicines which is very staggering.
Methodologies, Follow-up Mechanisms and Governance 
In view of overcoming these challenges, we must proceed in a right direction to fulfill our objectives by providing Food Security, Health Security and Financial Security to the poor people for proper utilization of water resources by the by to save the “Nature and Environment” by adopting the following methodologies and governance

ABOUT US:

Our Organization is accredited to United Nations with ECOSOC status, accredited to UNEP and accredited to UNCCD and a potential member of IUCN. As such, we are working to save the Nature and save the Planet. Some of our activities are displayed hereunder:      

FOREST AND ENVIRONMENT:
Environmental degradation during these present days has become a Global Issue. Degradation of Forest, Extinction of Wild Animals, diminishing Biological diversity and Raise of Temperature are the acute problems and the vital cause of Environmental degradation. It is a broad concept which includes pollution of various biological and physical components of the planet as a result of which the entire world is going to be destroyed. 
Hence, we are working to Restore the Forest Landscape, Conservation of Nature, Biodiversity, Control the Desertification, Pollution, Restore the Environment and combat Climate Change and Providing the drinking water facility to save the endangered species and appropriate actions are being taken to accomplish our Goals and Targets. 

CLIMATE CHANGE-vs- AIR POLLUTION:
The Climate is changing and it is changing very fast. In view of this occurrence, some of the Global visionaries and International Agencies have come to a conclusion attributing the Population growth with a notion of equitable blames. But, in real sense the destructive activity of human beings is the main cause of climate change, pollution of Air, Water and Soil. In view of this fact, we endorse the Frameworks of the Climate Change by undertaking some important activities to address the Short-lived Climate Pollutants (SLCPs) from the Air. 

SUBSISTENCE AGRICULTURE AND GREEN ECONOMY:
Subsistence Agriculture is the only livelihood support opportunity that improves the individuals and poor Community well-beings. Hence, it is advisable to have this Subsistence Agricultural Farming that saves the lives of the Tribal people as well as keeps the Planet healthy. Subsistence Agriculture is also for elimination of Poverty and Hunger if the Nature-based Solutions are adopted. The crop is Eco-friendly, Climate friendly, Climate resilient, Climate smart, Carbon smart, Water smart, Energy smart and provides Employment facility. 

WATER AND SANITATION:
Conservation of water is a broad concept to save including the Environment and Ecosystem. Water is the second supreme ingredient on the construction of Human Body next to Earth as per mythological belief and treated as the baseline element and the elixir of life. Hence, it is contemplated to have the sustainable management of this most precious gift of Nature to save all the living beings on this Earth and to save the Planet. Hence, we need the water with sanitary measures to lead a healthy life and healthy survival. 

MARINE ECOSYSTEM AND BLUE ECONOMY:
We are working to save and protect the Marine Mammals like Shark, Whales, Dolphins and other endangered fish species and Marine Ecosystem. Blue Economy is the new approach of sustainability and the world acknowledges the role of our Oceans that “Only a healthy Marine Ecosystem can offer ecosystem goods and services to increasing rate of population”.",0.875,0.4444444444444444,0.0,0.0,1.0,0.05494505494505515
