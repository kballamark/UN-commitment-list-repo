Classify the financial viability of the project or commitment by evaluating the level of certainty in the 
financial information provided. Unclear (1): The description lacks financial details, making it challenging 
to assess the funding status. This category includes scenarios where financial support is merely implied, 
hinted at with vague terms, or contingent on events that have yet to occur. Look for phrases that suggest 
uncertainty or dependency, such as 'expected funding' or 'seeking sponsors'. Partially Clear (2): Here, 
there's some evidence of financial or non-financial resources thought or initial planning, although not 
fully detailed. This could manifest as mentions of potential resources (like faculty, equipment, staff 
hours, university students, expertise used on the topic, or manpower) or informal commitments from stakeholders. 
The key is the presence of some resource allocational direction or support, albeit without precise figures or 
finalized plans. Clear and Sustainable Funding (3): This category is marked by explicit, detailed financial plans 
with confirmed funding sources and specific monetary commitments. It should include quantifiable financial figures, 
such as budget allocations, funding agreements, or financial projections, which collectively ensure the commitment's 
viability and sustainability. Look for detailed budgets, named funding sources, and financial timelines that demonstrate 
a well-structured financial foundation. Look for numbers standing for amounts, typically in dollar $ or euro or other 
valuta. Also, bear in mind that even though the criteria for Partially clear classification group applies to sustainable 
financials, if it is supported by figures or monetary indications, e.g. , concrete amount of money, it should be classified 
as number 3, clear and sustainable funding. If there is a financial number, let's say $12M or 12$, it should always be 
classified as Clear and Sustainable funding. Some concrete examples to help the classification: If the text contains 
'Other, please specify' or 'in-kind contribution', or 'NaN', then it is Unclear, hence category 1. If the text contains 
'Staff / technical expertise', then it is partially clear, hence category 2. If the text contains phrase like 
'Financing (in USD)' or a concrete number like '$10M', then it is Clear and Sustainable funding, hence category 3.
