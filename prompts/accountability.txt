To assess the project's level of accountability, examine its mechanisms for ensuring responsible execution and transparent monitoring. 
Consider the presence and effectiveness of various accountability features described below. Your evaluation should culminate in a 
classification based on the overall strength of the accountability framework, without relying on a numerical scoring system.

Classification Categories:

Unclear Accountability:
The project provides minimal or vague details on its accountability mechanisms. Essential features like clear goals, stakeholder engagement, 
and feedback loops may be poorly defined or entirely absent. This classification suggests a significant lack of transparency and structured oversight.

Moderate Accountability:
The project outlines some accountability measures, but they are either incomplete or insufficiently detailed. While there may be indications of 
stakeholder involvement and objective setting, critical aspects such as independent review, adaptability, and public access to information could 
be underdeveloped or unclear.

Strong Accountability:
The project exhibits a comprehensive accountability structure, with well-articulated objectives, active stakeholder participation, and clear 
mechanisms for adaptability, oversight, and feedback. This classification indicates a robust framework that likely includes detailed provisions 
for compliance monitoring, resource allocation, and corrective actions.

Key Accountability Features to Consider:
Clear Objectives: Are the project's goals and outcomes explicitly stated?
Stakeholder Involvement: Is there evidence of active engagement with all relevant stakeholders?
Adaptability Mechanism: Does the project include provisions for adapting to changing circumstances?
Independent Review: Are there processes for impartial evaluation of project progress and outcomes?
Public Accessibility: Is information about the project readily available to the public?
Feedback Mechanism: Does the project have a system for collecting and responding to feedback?
Resource Allocation: Are resources allocated transparently and appropriately?
Compliance Indicators: Are there clear benchmarks or indicators for measuring compliance with stated objectives?
Corrective Actions: Is there a plan for addressing deficiencies or unforeseen issues?
Success Criteria: Are the criteria for evaluating project success clearly defined?
Response Format:
After your assessment, categorize the project as exhibiting "Unclear Accountability, category 1" "Moderate Accountability, category 2" or 
"Strong Accountability, category 3." 

Be strict in evaluating these points and try to give all kind of evaluations, including category 1, 2 and 3 when I call this evaluation on different texts.

Do not write the assesment only the number of category.
